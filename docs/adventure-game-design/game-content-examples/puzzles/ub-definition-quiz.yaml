question: |
  Answer these questions about undefined behavior (True or False):

  1. Undefined behavior means the program will always crash
  2. The compiler may assume undefined behavior never occurs in correct programs
  3. Reading an uninitialized variable is always undefined behavior in all C++ versions
  4. The as-if rule still applies even when undefined behavior occurs

answers: [F, T, F, F]

explanation: |
  1. FALSE - UB can manifest as anything: crashes, "working" code, silent corruption,
     or behavior that varies between runs, compilers, or optimization levels.

  2. TRUE - Compilers optimize assuming UB never happens. This is a fundamental
     assumption that enables many optimizations. If UB could occur, the compiler
     would have to be much more conservative.

  3. FALSE - In C++26, reading an uninitialized `unsigned char` or `std::byte`
     becomes erroneous behavior, not undefined. The Undefined Realm shrinks!

  4. FALSE - The as-if rule requires preserving observable behavior. But when
     undefined behavior occurs, there are "no requirements" - the as-if rule
     is void. The implementation may do literally anything.

hints:
  - "Remember: undefined behavior means 'no requirements' - not 'will crash'"
  - "Think about what the compiler is allowed to assume about correct programs"
  - "Consider how C++26 changed the rules for uninitialized byte-like types"
