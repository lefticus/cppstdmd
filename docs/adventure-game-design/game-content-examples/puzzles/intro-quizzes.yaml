  # Quiz for Quest 2: Explore the Foundations

    question: |
      Quick check on C++ fundamentals (True or False):

      1. A declaration introduces a name to the compiler
      2. Every definition is also a declaration
      3. An object's lifetime begins when its constructor completes

    answers: [T, T, T]

    explanation: |
      1. TRUE - A declaration introduces a name and its type to the compiler,
         allowing it to be used in later code.

      2. TRUE - Every definition is also a declaration! But not every declaration
         is a definition (e.g., `extern int x;` declares but doesn't define).

      3. TRUE - An object's lifetime begins when its constructor completes
         successfully. Before that, the object is being initialized but
         doesn't yet have a lifetime.

    hints:
      - "Think about what 'extern' does - is it a declaration or definition?"
      - "Consider when you can actually use an object safely"

  # Quiz for Quest 3: Meet the Guardians

    difficulty: easy

    question: |
      Test your understanding of RAII and smart pointers (True or False):

      1. RAII stands for "Resource Acquisition Is Initialization"
      2. A unique_ptr can be copied to share ownership
      3. When a unique_ptr goes out of scope, it automatically deletes its resource

    answers: [T, F, T]

    explanation: |
      1. TRUE - RAII means acquiring resources in constructors and releasing
         them in destructors. The destructor always runs when scope ends!

      2. FALSE - unique_ptr cannot be copied (it has deleted copy operations).
         That's what makes it "unique"! Use std::move to transfer ownership,
         or use shared_ptr if you need shared ownership.

      3. TRUE - That's the whole point of unique_ptr! When it goes out of scope,
         its destructor runs and deletes the managed resource. No manual delete needed.

    hints:
      - "The 'unique' in unique_ptr is a big hint about copying..."
      - "RAII ties resource lifetime to object lifetime"
