# Iterator Category Matching Puzzle
# Test knowledge of the iterator category hierarchy.

id: iterator_categories
type: matching
location: iterator.requirements
difficulty: medium
minLevel: 5

question: |
  The Standard Library defines a hierarchy of iterator categories.
  Match each iterator category with its defining capability:

pairs:
  - [Input Iterator, Single-pass read (can only traverse once)]
  - [Output Iterator, Single-pass write (can only write once)]
  - [Forward Iterator, Multi-pass (can traverse multiple times)]
  - [Bidirectional Iterator, Can move backwards (--it)]
  - [Random Access Iterator, O(1) arbitrary access (it + n)]
  - [Contiguous Iterator, Elements stored contiguously in memory]

hints:
  - |
    Think about what operations each category adds.
    Input/Output are the most limited - single pass only.
  - |
    The hierarchy builds up: Forward adds multi-pass,
    Bidirectional adds reverse traversal,
    Random Access adds arbitrary jumps.
  - |
    Read [[iterator.requirements]] for the complete
    requirements of each category.
