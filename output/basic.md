# Basics <a id="basic">[basic]</a>

## Preamble <a id="basic.pre">[basic.pre]</a>

\[*Note 1*: This Clause presents the basic concepts of the C++ language.
It explains the difference between an object and a name and how they
relate to the value categories for expressions. It introduces the
concepts of a declaration and a definition and presents C++’s notion of
type, scope, linkage, and storage duration. The mechanisms for starting
and terminating a program are discussed. Finally, this Clause presents
the fundamental types of the language and lists the ways of constructing
compound types from these. — *end note*\]

\[*Note 2*: This Clause does not cover concepts that affect only a
single part of the language. Such concepts are discussed in the relevant
Clauses. — *end note*\]

An *entity* is a value, object, reference, structured binding, function,
enumerator, type, class member, bit-field, template, template
specialization, namespace, or pack.

A *name* is an *identifier* [lex.name], *operator-function-id*
[over.oper], *literal-operator-id* [over.literal], or
*conversion-function-id* [class.conv.fct].

Every name is introduced by a *declaration*, which is a

- *name-declaration*, *block-declaration*, or *member-declaration*
  [dcl.pre], [class.mem],

- *init-declarator* [dcl.decl],

- in a structured binding declaration [dcl.struct.bind],

- *init-capture* [expr.prim.lambda.capture],

- *condition* with a *declarator* [stmt.pre],

- *member-declarator* [class.mem],

- *using-declarator* [namespace.udecl],

- *parameter-declaration* [dcl.fct],

- *type-parameter* [temp.param],

- that introduces a name [dcl.type.elab],

- *class-specifier* [class.pre],

- *enum-specifier* or *enumerator-definition* [dcl.enum],

- *exception-declaration* [except.pre], or

- implicit declaration of an injected-class-name [class.pre].

\[*Note 3*: The interpretation of a *for-range-declaration* produces one
or more of the above [stmt.ranged]. — *end note*\]

An entity E is denoted by the name (if any) that is introduced by a
declaration of E or by a *typedef-name* introduced by a declaration
specifying E.

A *variable* is introduced by the declaration of a reference other than
a non-static data member or of an object. The variable’s name, if any,
denotes the reference or object.

A *local entity* is a variable with automatic storage duration
[basic.stc.auto], a structured binding [dcl.struct.bind] whose
corresponding variable is such an entity, or the `*this` object
[expr.prim.this].

Some names denote types or templates. In general, whenever a name is
encountered it is necessary to determine whether that name denotes one
of these entities before continuing to parse the program that contains
it. The process that determines this is called *name lookup*
[basic.lookup].

Two names are *the same* if

- they are *identifier* composed of the same character sequence, or

- they are *operator-function-id* formed with the same operator, or

- they are *conversion-function-id* formed with equivalent
  [temp.over.link] types, or

- they are *literal-operator-id* [over.literal] formed with the same
  literal suffix identifier.

A name used in more than one translation unit can potentially refer to
the same entity in these translation units depending on the linkage
[basic.link] of the name specified in each translation unit.

## Declarations and definitions <a id="basic.def">[basic.def]</a>

A declaration [dcl.dcl] may (re)introduce one or more names and/or
entities into a translation unit. If so, the declaration specifies the
interpretation and semantic properties of these names. A declaration of
an entity or *typedef-name* X is a redeclaration of X if another
declaration of X is reachable from it [module.reach]. A declaration may
also have effects including:

- a static assertion [dcl.pre],

- controlling template instantiation [temp.explicit],

- guiding template argument deduction for constructors
  [temp.deduct.guide],

- use of attributes [dcl.attr], and

- nothing (in the case of an *empty-declaration*).

Each entity declared by a *declaration* is also *defined* by that
declaration unless:

- it declares a function without specifying the function’s body
  [dcl.fct.def],

- it contains the `extern` specifier [dcl.stc] or a
  *linkage-specification*

  and neither an *initializer* nor a *function-body*,

-  it declares a non-inline static data member in a class definition
  [class.mem], [class.static],

- it declares a static data member outside a class definition and the
  variable was defined within the class with the `constexpr` specifier
  (this usage is deprecated; see [depr.static.constexpr]),

-  it is an *elaborated-type-specifier* [class.name],

- it is an *opaque-enum-declaration* [dcl.enum],

- it is a *template-parameter* [temp.param],

- it is a *parameter-declaration* [dcl.fct] in a function declarator
  that is not the *declarator* of a *function-definition*,

- it is a `typedef` declaration [dcl.typedef],

- it is an *alias-declaration* [dcl.typedef],

- it is a *using-declaration* [namespace.udecl],

- it is a *deduction-guide* [temp.deduct.guide],

- it is a *static_assert-declaration* [dcl.pre],

- it is an *attribute-declaration* [dcl.pre],

- it is an *empty-declaration* [dcl.pre],

- it is a *using-directive* [namespace.udir],

- it is a *using-enum-declaration* [enum.udecl],

- it is a *template-declaration* [temp.pre] whose *template-head* is not
  followed by either a *concept-definition* or a *declaration* that
  defines a function, a class, a variable, or a static data member.

- it is an explicit instantiation declaration [temp.explicit], or

- it is an explicit specialization [temp.expl.spec] whose *declaration*
  is not a definition.

A declaration is said to be a *definition* of each entity that it
defines.

\[*Example 1*:

All but one of the following are definitions:

``` cpp
int a;                          // defines a
extern const int c = 1;         // defines c
int f(int x) { return x+a; }    // defines f and defines x
struct S { int a; int b; };     // defines S, S::a, and S::b
struct X {                      // defines X
  int x;                        // defines non-static data member x
  static int y;                 // declares static data member y
  X(): x(0) { }                 // defines a constructor of X
};
int X::y = 1;                   // defines X::y
enum { up, down };              // defines up and down
namespace N { int d; }          // defines N and N::d
namespace N1 = N;               // defines N1
X anX;                          // defines anX
```

whereas these are just declarations:

``` cpp
extern int a;                   // declares a
extern const int c;             // declares c
int f(int);                     // declares f
struct S;                       // declares S
typedef int Int;                // declares Int
extern X anotherX;              // declares anotherX
using N::d;                     // declares d
```

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 1*:  In some circumstances, C++ implementations implicitly
define the default constructor [class.default.ctor], copy constructor,
move constructor [class.copy.ctor], copy assignment operator, move
assignment operator [class.copy.assign], or destructor [class.dtor]
member functions. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 2*:

Given

``` cpp
#include <string>

struct C {
  std::string s;                // std::string is the standard library class[string.classes]
};

int main() {
  C a;
  C b = a;
  b = a;
}
```

the implementation will implicitly define functions to make the
definition of `C` equivalent to

``` cpp
struct C {
  std::string s;
  C() : s() { }
  C(const C& x): s(x.s) { }
  C(C&& x): s(static_cast<std::string&&>(x.s)) { }
      \rlap{\normalfont\itshape //}    : s(std::move(x.s)) { }
  C& operator=(const C& x) { s = x.s; return *this; }
  C& operator=(C&& x) { s = static_cast<std::string&&>(x.s); return *this; }
      \rlap{\normalfont\itshape //}                { s = std::move(x.s); return *this; }
  ~C() { }
};
```

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 2*: A class name can also be implicitly declared by an
*elaborated-type-specifier* [dcl.type.elab]. — *end note*\]

In the definition of an object, the type of that object shall not be an
incomplete type [term.incomplete.type], an abstract class type
[class.abstract], or a (possibly multidimensional) array thereof.

## One-definition rule <a id="basic.def.odr">[basic.def.odr]</a>

Each of the following is termed a *definable item*:

- a class type [class],

- an enumeration type [dcl.enum],

- a function [dcl.fct],

- a variable [basic.pre],

- a templated entity [temp.pre],

- a default argument for a parameter (for a function in a given scope)
  [dcl.fct.default], or

- a default template argument [temp.param].

No translation unit shall contain more than one definition of any
definable item.

An expression or conversion is *potentially evaluated* unless it is an
unevaluated operand [expr.context], a subexpression thereof, or a
conversion in an initialization or conversion sequence in such a
context. The set of *potential results* of an expression E is defined as
follows:

- If E is an *id-expression* [expr.prim.id], the set contains only E.

- If E is a subscripting operation [expr.sub] with an array operand, the
  set contains the potential results of that operand.

- If E is a class member access expression [expr.ref] of the form E₁ `.`
  `template` E₂ naming a non-static data member, the set contains the
  potential results of E₁.

- If E is a class member access expression naming a static data member,
  the set contains the *id-expression* designating the data member.

- If E is a pointer-to-member expression [expr.mptr.oper] of the form E₁
  `.*` E₂, the set contains the potential results of E₁.

- If E has the form `($E_1$)`, the set contains the potential results of
  E₁.

- If E is a glvalue conditional expression [expr.cond], the set is the
  union of the sets of potential results of the second and third
  operands.

- If E is a comma expression [expr.comma], the set contains the
  potential results of the right operand.

- Otherwise, the set is empty.

\[*Note 1*:

This set is a (possibly-empty) set of *id-expression*, each of which is
either E or a subexpression of E.

— *end note*\]

A function is *named by* an expression or conversion as follows:

- A function is named by an expression or conversion if it is the
  selected member of an overload set
  [basic.lookup], [over.match], [over.over] in an overload resolution
  performed as part of forming that expression or conversion, unless it
  is a pure virtual function and either the expression is not an
  *id-expression* naming the function with an explicitly qualified name
  or the expression forms a pointer to member [expr.unary.op].

  \[*Note 1*: This covers taking the address of functions
  [conv.func], [expr.unary.op], calls to named functions [expr.call],
  operator overloading [over], user-defined conversions
  [class.conv.fct], allocation functions for *new-expression*
  [expr.new], as well as non-default initialization [dcl.init]. A
  constructor selected to copy or move an object of class type is
  considered to be named by an expression or conversion even if the call
  is actually elided by the implementation
  [class.copy.elision]. — *end note*\]

- A deallocation function for a class is named by a *new-expression* if
  it is the single matching deallocation function for the allocation
  function selected by overload resolution, as specified in  [expr.new].

- A deallocation function for a class is named by a *delete-expression*
  if it is the selected usual deallocation function as specified in 
  [expr.delete] and  [class.free].

A variable is named by an expression if the expression is an
*id-expression* that denotes it. A variable `x` that is named by a
potentially-evaluated expression E is *odr-used* by E unless

- `x` is a reference that is usable in constant expressions
  [expr.const], or

- `x` is a variable of non-reference type that is usable in constant
  expressions and has no mutable subobjects, and E is an element of the
  set of potential results of an expression of non-volatile-qualified
  non-class type to which the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion [conv.lval] is
  applied, or

- `x` is a variable of non-reference type, and E is an element of the
  set of potential results of a discarded-value expression
  [expr.context] to which the lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is not
  applied.

A structured binding is odr-used if it appears as a
potentially-evaluated expression.

`*this` is odr-used if `this` appears as a potentially-evaluated
expression (including as the result of the implicit transformation in
the body of a non-static member function [class.mfct.non.static]).

A virtual member function is odr-used if it is not pure. A function is
odr-used if it is named by a potentially-evaluated expression or
conversion. A non-placement allocation or deallocation function for a
class is odr-used by the definition of a constructor of that class. A
non-placement deallocation function for a class is odr-used by the
definition of the destructor of that class, or by being selected by the
lookup at the point of definition of a virtual destructor [class.dtor].

An assignment operator function in a class is odr-used by an
implicitly-defined copy-assignment or move-assignment function for
another class as specified in  [class.copy.assign]. A constructor for a
class is odr-used as specified in  [dcl.init]. A destructor for a class
is odr-used if it is potentially invoked [class.dtor].

A local entity [basic.pre] is *odr-usable* in a scope
[basic.scope.scope] if:

- either the local entity is not `*this`, or an enclosing class or
  non-lambda function parameter scope exists and, if the innermost such
  scope is a function parameter scope, it corresponds to a non-static
  member function, and

- for each intervening scope [basic.scope.scope] between the point at
  which the entity is introduced and the scope (where `*this` is
  considered to be introduced within the innermost enclosing class or
  non-lambda function definition scope), either:

  - the intervening scope is a block scope, or

  - the intervening scope is the function parameter scope of a
    *lambda-expression* that has a *simple-capture* naming the entity or
    has a *capture-default*, and the block scope of the
    *lambda-expression* is also an intervening scope.

If a local entity is odr-used in a scope in which it is not odr-usable,
the program is ill-formed.

\[*Example 1*:

``` cpp
void f(int n) {
  [] { n = 1; };                // error: n is not odr-usable due to intervening lambda-expression
  struct A {
    void f() { n = 2; }         // error: n is not odr-usable due to intervening function definition scope
  };
  void g(int = n);              // error: n is not odr-usable due to intervening function parameter scope
  [=](int k = n) {};            // error: n is not odr-usable due to being
                                // outside the block scope of the lambda-expression
  [&] { [n]{ return n; }; };    // OK
}
```

— *end example*\]

Every program shall contain at least one definition of every function or
variable that is odr-used in that program outside of a discarded
statement [stmt.if]; no diagnostic required. The definition can appear
explicitly in the program, it can be found in the standard or a
user-defined library, or (when appropriate) it is implicitly defined
(see  [class.default.ctor], [class.copy.ctor], [class.dtor], and
[class.copy.assign]).

\[*Example 2*:

``` cpp
auto f() {
  struct A {};
  return A{};
}
decltype(f()) g();
auto x = g();
```

A program containing this translation unit is ill-formed because `g` is
odr-used but not defined, and cannot be defined in any other translation
unit because the local class `A` cannot be named outside this
translation unit.

— *end example*\]

A *definition domain* is a *private-module-fragment* or the portion of a
translation unit excluding its *private-module-fragment* (if any). A
definition of an inline function or variable shall be reachable from the
end of every definition domain in which it is odr-used outside of a
discarded statement.

A definition of a class shall be reachable in every context in which the
class is used in a way that requires the class type to be complete.

\[*Example 3*:

The following complete translation unit is well-formed, even though it
never defines `X`:

``` cpp
struct X;                       // declare X as a struct type
struct X* x1;                   // use X in pointer formation
X* x2;                          // use X in pointer formation
```

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 2*:

The rules for declarations and expressions describe in which contexts
complete class types are required. A class type `T` must be complete if:

- an object of type `T` is defined [basic.def], or

- a non-static class data member of type `T` is declared [class.mem], or

- `T` is used as the allocated type or array element type in a
  *new-expression* [expr.new], or

- an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion is applied to a glvalue referring to an
  object of type `T` [conv.lval], or

- an expression is converted (either implicitly or explicitly) to type
  `T`
  [conv], [expr.type.conv], [expr.dynamic.cast], [expr.static.cast], [expr.cast],
  or

- an expression that is not a null pointer constant, and has type other
  than cv `void*`, is converted to the type pointer to `T` or reference
  to `T` using a standard conversion [conv], a `dynamic_cast`
  [expr.dynamic.cast] or a `static_cast` [expr.static.cast], or

- a class member access operator is applied to an expression of type `T`
  [expr.ref], or

- the `typeid` operator [expr.typeid] or the `sizeof` operator
  [expr.sizeof] is applied to an operand of type `T`, or

- a function with a return type or argument type of type `T` is defined
  [basic.def] or called [expr.call], or

- a class with a base class of type `T` is defined [class.derived], or

- an lvalue of type `T` is assigned to [expr.ass], or

- the type `T` is the subject of an `alignof` expression [expr.alignof],
  or

- an *exception-declaration* has type `T`, reference to `T`, or pointer
  to `T` [except.handle].

— *end note*\]

For any definable item `D` with definitions in multiple translation
units,

- if `D` is a non-inline non-templated function or variable, or

- if the definitions in different translation units do not satisfy the
  following requirements,

the program is ill-formed; a diagnostic is required only if the
definable item is attached to a named module and a prior definition is
reachable at the point where a later definition occurs. Given such an
item, for all definitions of `D`, or, if `D` is an unnamed enumeration,
for all definitions of `D` that are reachable at any given program
point, the following requirements shall be satisfied.

- Each such definition shall not be attached to a named module
  [module.unit].

- Each such definition shall consist of the same sequence of tokens,
  where the definition of a closure type is considered to consist of the
  sequence of tokens of the corresponding *lambda-expression*.

- In each such definition, corresponding names, looked up according to 
  [basic.lookup], shall refer to the same entity, after overload
  resolution [over.match] and after matching of partial template
  specialization [temp.over], except that a name can refer to

  - a non-volatile const object with internal or no linkage if the
    object

    - has the same literal type in all definitions of `D`,

    - is initialized with a constant expression [expr.const],

    - is not odr-used in any definition of `D`, and

    - has the same value in all definitions of `D`,

    or

  - a reference with internal or no linkage initialized with a constant
    expression such that the reference refers to the same entity in all
    definitions of `D`.

- In each such definition, except within the default arguments and
  default template arguments of `D`, corresponding *lambda-expression*
  shall have the same closure type (see below).

- In each such definition, corresponding entities shall have the same
  language linkage.

- In each such definition, const objects with static or thread storage
  duration shall be constant-initialized if the object is
  constant-initialized in any such definition.

- In each such definition, corresponding manifestly constant-evaluated
  expressions that are not value-dependent shall have the same value
  [expr.const], [temp.dep.constexpr].

- In each such definition, the overloaded operators referred to, the
  implicit calls to conversion functions, constructors, operator new
  functions and operator delete functions, shall refer to the same
  function.

- In each such definition, a default argument used by an (implicit or
  explicit) function call or a default template argument used by an
  (implicit or explicit) *template-id* or *simple-template-id* is
  treated as if its token sequence were present in the definition of
  `D`; that is, the default argument or default template argument is
  subject to the requirements described in this paragraph (recursively).

- If `D` is a class with an implicitly-declared constructor
  [class.default.ctor], [class.copy.ctor], it is as if the constructor
  was implicitly defined in every translation unit where it is odr-used,
  and the implicit definition in every translation unit shall call the
  same constructor for a subobject of `D`.

  \[*Example 1*:

  ``` cpp
  // translation unit 1:
  struct X {
    X(int, int);
    X(int, int, int);
  };
  X::X(int, int = 0) { }
  class D {
    X x = 0;
  };
  D d1;                           // X(int, int) called by D()

  // translation unit 2:
  struct X {
    X(int, int);
    X(int, int, int);
  };
  X::X(int, int = 0, int = 0) { }
  class D {
    X x = 0;
  };
  D d2;                           // X(int, int, int) called by D();
                                  // D()'s implicit definition violates the ODR
  ```

  — *end example*\]

- If `D` is a class with a defaulted three-way comparison operator
  function [class.spaceship], it is as if the operator was implicitly
  defined in every translation unit where it is odr-used, and the
  implicit definition in every translation unit shall call the same
  comparison operators for each subobject of `D`.

If `D` is a template and is defined in more than one translation unit,
then the preceding requirements shall apply both to names from the
template’s enclosing scope used in the template definition, and also to
dependent names at the point of instantiation [temp.dep]. These
requirements also apply to corresponding entities defined within each
definition of `D` (including the closure types of *lambda-expression*,
but excluding entities defined within default arguments or default
template arguments of either `D` or an entity not defined within `D`).
For each such entity and for `D` itself, the behavior is as if there is
a single entity with a single definition, including in the application
of these requirements to other entities.

\[*Note 3*: The entity is still declared in multiple translation units,
and [basic.link] still applies to these declarations. In particular,
*lambda-expression* [expr.prim.lambda] appearing in the type of `D` can
result in the different declarations having distinct types, and
*lambda-expression* appearing in a default argument of `D` might still
denote different types in different translation units. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 4*:

``` cpp
inline void f(bool cond, void (*p)()) {
  if (cond) f(false, []{});
}
inline void g(bool cond, void (*p)() = []{}) {
  if (cond) g(false);
}
struct X {
  void h(bool cond, void (*p)() = []{}) {
    if (cond) h(false);
  }
};
```

If the definition of `f` appears in multiple translation units, the
behavior of the program is as if there is only one definition of `f`. If
the definition of `g` appears in multiple translation units, the program
is ill-formed (no diagnostic required) because each such definition uses
a default argument that refers to a distinct *lambda-expression* closure
type. The definition of `X` can appear in multiple translation units of
a valid program; the *lambda-expression* defined within the default
argument of `X::h` within the definition of `X` denote the same closure
type in each translation unit.

— *end example*\]

If, at any point in the program, there is more than one reachable
unnamed enumeration definition in the same scope that have the same
first enumerator name and do not have typedef names for linkage purposes
[dcl.enum], those unnamed enumeration types shall be the same; no
diagnostic required.

## Scope <a id="basic.scope">[basic.scope]</a>

### General <a id="basic.scope.scope">[basic.scope.scope]</a>

The declarations in a program appear in a number of *scopes* that are in
general discontiguous. The *global scope* contains the entire program;
every other scope S is introduced by a declaration,
*parameter-declaration-clause*, *statement*, or *handler* (as described
in the following subclauses of [basic.scope]) appearing in another scope
which thereby contains S. An *enclosing scope* at a program point is any
scope that contains it; the smallest such scope is said to be the
*immediate scope* at that point. A scope *intervenes* between a program
point P and a scope S (that does not contain P) if it is or contains S
but does not contain P.

Unless otherwise specified:

- The smallest scope that contains a scope S is the *parent scope* of S.

- No two declarations (re)introduce the same entity.

- A declaration *inhabits* the immediate scope at its locus
  [basic.scope.pdecl].

- A declaration’s *target scope* is the scope it inhabits.

- Any names (re)introduced by a declaration are *bound* to it in its
  target scope.

An entity *belongs* to a scope S if S is the target scope of a
declaration of the entity.

\[*Note 1*:

Special cases include that:

- Template parameter scopes are parents only to other template parameter
  scopes [basic.scope.temp].

- Corresponding declarations with appropriate linkage declare the same
  entity [basic.link].

- The declaration in a *template-declaration* inhabits the same scope as
  the *template-declaration*.

- Friend declarations and declarations of qualified names and template
  specializations do not bind names [dcl.meaning]; those with qualified
  names target a specified scope, and other friend declarations and
  certain *elaborated-type-specifier*s [dcl.type.elab] target a larger
  enclosing scope.

- Block-scope extern declarations target a larger enclosing scope but
  bind a name in their immediate scope.

- The names of unscoped enumerators are bound in the two innermost
  enclosing scopes [dcl.enum].

- A class’s name is also bound in its own scope [class.pre].

- The names of the members of an anonymous union are bound in the
  union’s parent scope [class.union.anon].

— *end note*\]

Two non-static member functions have if:

- exactly one is an implicit object member function with no
  *ref-qualifier* and the types of their object parameters [dcl.fct],
  after removing top-level references, are the same, or

- their object parameters have the same type.

Two non-static member function templates have if:

- exactly one is an implicit object member function with no
  *ref-qualifier* and the types of their object parameters, after
  removing any references, are equivalent, or

- the types of their object parameters are equivalent.

Two function templates have if their *template-parameter-list* have the
same length, their corresponding *template-parameter* are equivalent,
they have equivalent non-object-parameter-type-lists and return types
(if any), and, if both are non-static members, they have corresponding
object parameters.

Two declarations *correspond* if they (re)introduce the same name, both
declare constructors, or both declare destructors, unless

- either is a *using-declarator*, or

- one declares a type (not a *typedef-name*) and the other declares a
  variable, non-static data member other than of an anonymous union
  [class.union.anon], enumerator, function, or function template, or

- each declares a function or function template, except when

  - both declare functions with the same non-object-parameter-type-list,

    equivalent [temp.over.link] trailing *requires-clause*s (if any,
    except as specified in [temp.friend]), and, if both are non-static
    members, they have corresponding object parameters, or

  - both declare function templates with corresponding signatures and
    equivalent *template-head*s and trailing *requires-clause*s (if
    any).

\[*Note 2*:

Declarations can correspond even if neither binds a name.

— *end note*\]

\[*Example 1*:

``` cpp
typedef int Int;
enum E : int { a };
void f(int);                    // \#1
void f(Int) {}                  // defines \#1
void f(E) {}                    // OK, another overload

struct X {
  static void f();
  void f() const;               // error: redeclaration
  void g();
  void g() const;               // OK
  void g() &;                   // error: redeclaration

  void h(this X&, int);
  void h(int) &&;               // OK, another overload
  void j(this const X&);
  void j() const &;             // error: redeclaration
  void k();
  void k(this X&);              // error: redeclaration
};
```

— *end example*\]

Two declarations *potentially conflict* if they correspond and cause
their shared name to denote different entities [basic.link]. The program
is ill-formed if, in any scope, a name is bound to two declarations that
potentially conflict and one precedes the other [basic.lookup].

\[*Note 3*: Overload resolution can consider potentially conflicting
declarations found in multiple scopes (e.g., via *using-directive*s or
for operator functions), in which case it is often
ambiguous. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 2*:

``` cpp
void f() {
  int x,y;
  void x();             // error: different entity for x
  int y;                // error: redefinition
}
enum { f };             // error: different entity for ::f
namespace A {}
namespace B = A;
namespace B = A;        // OK, no effect
namespace B = B;        // OK, no effect
namespace A = B;        // OK, no effect
namespace B {}          // error: different entity for B
```

— *end example*\]

A declaration is *nominable* in a class, class template, or namespace E
at a point P if it precedes P, it does not inhabit a block scope, and
its target scope is the scope associated with E or, if E is a namespace,
any element of the inline namespace set of E [namespace.def].

\[*Example 3*:

``` cpp
namespace A {
  void f() {void g();}
  inline namespace B {
    struct S {
      friend void h();
      static int i;
    };
  }
}
```

At the end of this example, the declarations of `f`, `B`, `S`, and `h`
are nominable in `A`, but those of `g` and `i` are not.

— *end example*\]

When instantiating a templated entity [temp.pre], any scope S introduced
by any part of the template definition is considered to be introduced by
the instantiated entity and to contain the instantiations of any
declarations that inhabit S.

### Point of declaration <a id="basic.scope.pdecl">[basic.scope.pdecl]</a>

The *locus* of a declaration [basic.pre] that is a declarator is
immediately after the complete declarator [dcl.decl].

\[*Example 4*:

``` cpp
unsigned char x = 12;
{ unsigned char x = x; }
```

Here, the initialization of the second `x` has undefined behavior,
because the initializer accesses the second `x` outside its lifetime
[basic.life].

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 4*:

A name from an outer scope remains visible up to the locus of the
declaration that hides it.

— *end note*\]

The locus of a *class-specifier* is immediately after the *identifier*
or *simple-template-id* (if any) in its *class-head* [class.pre]. The
locus of an *enum-specifier* is immediately after its *enum-head*; the
locus of an *opaque-enum-declaration* is immediately after it
[dcl.enum]. The locus of an *alias-declaration* is immediately after it.

The locus of a *using-declarator* that does not name a constructor is
immediately after the *using-declarator* [namespace.udecl].

The locus of an *enumerator-definition* is immediately after it.

\[*Example 5*:

``` cpp
const int x = 12;
{ enum { x = x }; }
```

Here, the enumerator `x` is initialized with the value of the constant
`x`, namely 12.

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 5*:

After the declaration of a class member, the member name can be found in
the scope of its class even if the class is an incomplete class.

— *end note*\]

The locus of an *elaborated-type-specifier* that is a declaration
[dcl.type.elab] is immediately after it.

The locus of an injected-class-name declaration [class.pre] is
immediately following the opening brace of the class definition.

The locus of the implicit declaration of a function-local predefined
variable [dcl.fct.def.general] is immediately before the *function-body*
of its function’s definition.

The locus of the declaration of a structured binding [dcl.struct.bind]
is immediately after the *identifier-list* of the structured binding
declaration.

The locus of a *for-range-declaration* of a range-based `for` statement
[stmt.ranged] is immediately after the *for-range-initializer*.

The locus of a *template-parameter* is immediately after it.

\[*Example 6*:

``` cpp
typedef unsigned char T;
template<class T
  = T               // lookup finds the typedef-name
  , T               // lookup finds the template parameter
    N = 0> struct A { };
```

— *end example*\]

The locus of a *concept-definition* is immediately after its
concept-name [temp.concept].

\[*Note 6*: The *constraint-expression* cannot use the
*concept-name*. — *end note*\]

The locus of a *namespace-definition* with an *identifier* is
immediately after the *identifier*.

\[*Note 7*: An identifier is invented for an
*unnamed-namespace-definition* [namespace.unnamed]. — *end note*\]

\[*Note 8*: Friend declarations can introduce functions or classes that
belong to the nearest enclosing namespace or block scope, but they do
not bind names anywhere [class.friend]. Function declarations at block
scope and variable declarations with the `extern` specifier at block
scope declare entities that belong to the nearest enclosing namespace,
but they do not bind names in it. — *end note*\]

\[*Note 9*: For point of instantiation of a template, see 
[temp.point]. — *end note*\]

### Block scope <a id="basic.scope.block">[basic.scope.block]</a>

Each

- selection or iteration statement [stmt.select], [stmt.iter],

- substatement of such a statement,

-  *handler* [except.pre], or

- compound statement [stmt.block] that is not the *compound-statement*
  of a *handler*

introduces a *block scope* that includes that statement or *handler*.

\[*Note 10*: A substatement that is also a block has only one
scope. — *end note*\]

A variable that belongs to a block scope is a *block variable*.

\[*Example 7*:

``` cpp
int i = 42;
int a[10];

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  a[i] = i;

int j = i;          // j = 42
```

— *end example*\]

If a declaration whose target scope is the block scope S of a

- *compound-statement* of a *lambda-expression*, *function-body*, or
  *function-try-block*,

- substatement of a selection or iteration statement that is not itself
  a selection or iteration statement, or

- *handler* of a *function-try-block*

potentially conflicts with a declaration whose target scope is the
parent scope of S, the program is ill-formed.

\[*Example 8*:

``` cpp
if (int x = f()) {
  int x;            // error: redeclaration of x
}
else {
  int x;            // error: redeclaration of x
}
```

— *end example*\]

### Function parameter scope <a id="basic.scope.param">[basic.scope.param]</a>

A *parameter-declaration-clause* P introduces a
*function parameter scope* that includes P.

\[*Note 11*: A function parameter cannot be used for its value within
the *parameter-declaration-clause* [dcl.fct.default]. — *end note*\]

- If P is associated with a *declarator* and is preceded by a
  (possibly-parenthesized) *noptr-declarator* of the form
  *declarator-id* *attribute-specifier-seq*, its scope extends to the
  end of the nearest enclosing *init-declarator*, *member-declarator*,
  *declarator* of a *parameter-declaration* or a
  *nodeclspec-function-declaration*, or *function-definition*, but does
  not include the locus of the associated *declarator*.

  \[*Note 2*: In this case, P declares the parameters of a function (or
  a function or template parameter declared with function type). A
  member function’s parameter scope is nested within its class’s
  scope. — *end note*\]

- If P is associated with a *lambda-declarator*, its scope extends to
  the end of the *compound-statement* in the *lambda-expression*.

- If P is associated with a *requirement-parameter-list*, its scope
  extends to the end of the *requirement-body* of the
  requires-expression.

- If P is associated with a *deduction-guide*, its scope extends to the
  end of the *deduction-guide*.

### Lambda scope <a id="basic.scope.lambda">[basic.scope.lambda]</a>

A *lambda-expression* `E` introduces a *lambda scope* that starts
immediately after the *lambda-introducer* of `E` and extends to the end
of the *compound-statement* of `E`.

### Namespace scope <a id="basic.scope.namespace">[basic.scope.namespace]</a>

Any *namespace-definition* for a namespace N introduces a
*namespace scope* that includes the *namespace-body* for every
*namespace-definition* for N. For each non-friend redeclaration or
specialization whose target scope is or is contained by the scope, the
portion after the *declarator-id*, *class-head-name*, or
*enum-head-name* is also included in the scope. The global scope is the
namespace scope of the global namespace [basic.namespace].

\[*Example 9*:

``` cpp
namespace Q {
  namespace V { void f(); }
  void V::f() {         // in the scope of V
    void h();           // declares Q::V::h
  }
}
```

— *end example*\]

### Class scope <a id="basic.scope.class">[basic.scope.class]</a>

Any declaration of a class or class template C introduces a
*class scope* that includes the *member-specification* of the
*class-specifier* for C (if any). For each non-friend redeclaration or
specialization whose target scope is or is contained by the scope, the
portion after the *declarator-id*, *class-head-name*, or
*enum-head-name* is also included in the scope.

\[*Note 12*:

Lookup from a program point before the *class-specifier* of a class will
find no bindings in the class scope.

— *end note*\]

### Enumeration scope <a id="basic.scope.enum">[basic.scope.enum]</a>

Any declaration of an enumeration E introduces an *enumeration scope*
that includes the *enumerator-list* of the *enum-specifier* for E (if
any).

### Template parameter scope <a id="basic.scope.temp">[basic.scope.temp]</a>

Each template *template-parameter* introduces a
*template parameter scope* that includes the *template-head* of the
*template-parameter*.

Each *template-declaration* D introduces a template parameter scope that
extends from the beginning of its *template-parameter-list* to the end
of the *template-declaration*. Any declaration outside the
*template-parameter-list* that would inhabit that scope instead inhabits
the same scope as D. The parent scope of any scope S that is not a
template parameter scope is the smallest scope that contains S and is
not a template parameter scope.

\[*Note 13*: Therefore, only template parameters belong to a template
parameter scope, and only template parameter scopes have a template
parameter scope as a parent scope. — *end note*\]

## Name lookup <a id="basic.lookup">[basic.lookup]</a>

### General <a id="basic.lookup.general">[basic.lookup.general]</a>

The name lookup rules apply uniformly to all names (including
*typedef-name* [dcl.typedef], *namespace-name* [basic.namespace], and
*class-name* [class.name]) wherever the grammar allows such names in the
context discussed by a particular rule. Name lookup associates the use
of a name with a set of declarations [basic.def] of that name. Unless
otherwise specified, the program is ill-formed if no declarations are
found. If the declarations found by name lookup all denote functions or
function templates, the declarations are said to form an *overload set*.
Otherwise, if the declarations found by name lookup do not all denote
the same entity, they are *ambiguous* and the program is ill-formed.
Overload resolution [over.match], [over.over] takes place after name
lookup has succeeded. The access rules [class.access] are considered
only once name lookup and function overload resolution (if applicable)
have succeeded. Only after name lookup, function overload resolution (if
applicable) and access checking have succeeded are the semantic
properties introduced by the declarations used in further processing.

A program point P is said to follow any declaration in the same
translation unit whose locus [basic.scope.pdecl] is before P.

\[*Note 1*: The declaration might appear in a scope that does not
contain P. — *end note*\]

A declaration X *precedes* a program point P in a translation unit L if
P follows X, X inhabits a class scope and is reachable from P, or else X
appears in a translation unit D and

- P follows a *module-import-declaration* or *module-declaration* that
  imports D (directly or indirectly), and

- X appears after the *module-declaration* in D (if any) and before the
  *private-module-fragment* in D (if any), and

- either X is exported or else D and L are part of the same module and X
  does not inhabit a namespace with internal linkage or declare a name
  with internal linkage.

  \[*Note 3*: Names declared by a *using-declaration* have no
  linkage. — *end note*\]

\[*Note 2*:

A *module-import-declaration* imports both the named translation unit(s)
and any modules named by exported *module-import-declaration* within
them, recursively.

— *end note*\]

A *single search* in a scope S for a name N from a program point P finds
all declarations that precede P to which any name that is the same as N
[basic.pre] is bound in S. If any such declaration is a
*using-declarator* whose terminal name [expr.prim.id.unqual] is not
dependent [temp.dep.type], it is replaced by the declarations named by
the *using-declarator* [namespace.udecl].

In certain contexts, only certain kinds of declarations are included.
After any such restriction, any declarations of classes or enumerations
are discarded if any other declarations are found.

\[*Note 3*: A type (but not a *typedef-name* or template) is therefore
hidden by any other entity in its scope. — *end note*\]

However, if a lookup is *type-only*, only declarations of types and
templates whose specializations are types are considered; furthermore,
if declarations of a *typedef-name* and of the type to which it refers
are found, the declaration of the *typedef-name* is discarded instead of
the type declaration.

### Member name lookup <a id="class.member.lookup">[class.member.lookup]</a>

A *search* in a scope X for a name M from a program point P is a single
search in X for M from P unless X is the scope of a class or class
template T, in which case the following steps define the result of the
search.

\[*Note 4*: The result differs only if M is a *conversion-function-id*
or if the single search would find nothing. — *end note*\]

The *lookup set* for a name N in a class or class template C, called
S(N,C), consists of two component sets: the *declaration set*, a set of
members named N; and the *subobject set*, a set of subobjects where
declarations of these members were found (possibly via
*using-declaration*). In the declaration set, type declarations
(including injected-class-names) are replaced by the types they
designate. S(N,C) is calculated as follows:

The declaration set is the result of a single search in the scope of C
for N from immediately after the *class-specifier* of C if P is in a
complete-class context of C or from P otherwise. If the resulting
declaration set is not empty, the subobject set contains C itself, and
calculation is complete.

Otherwise (i.e., C does not contain a declaration of N or the resulting
declaration set is empty), S(N,C) is initially empty. Calculate the
lookup set for N in each direct non-dependent [temp.dep.type] base class
subobject Bᵢ, and merge each such lookup set S(N,Bᵢ) in turn into
S(N,C).

\[*Note 5*: If C is incomplete, only base classes whose *base-specifier*
appears before P are considered. If C is an instantiated class, its base
classes are not dependent. — *end note*\]

The following steps define the result of merging lookup set S(N,Bᵢ) into
the intermediate S(N,C):

- If each of the subobject members of S(N,Bᵢ) is a base class subobject
  of at least one of the subobject members of S(N,C), or if S(N,Bᵢ) is
  empty, S(N,C) is unchanged and the merge is complete. Conversely, if
  each of the subobject members of S(N,C) is a base class subobject of
  at least one of the subobject members of S(N,Bᵢ), or if S(N,C) is
  empty, the new S(N,C) is a copy of S(N,Bᵢ).

- Otherwise, if the declaration sets of S(N,Bᵢ) and S(N,C) differ, the
  merge is ambiguous: the new S(N,C) is a lookup set with an invalid
  declaration set and the union of the subobject sets. In subsequent
  merges, an invalid declaration set is considered different from any
  other.

- Otherwise, the new S(N,C) is a lookup set with the shared set of
  declarations and the union of the subobject sets.

The result of the search is the declaration set of S(M,T). If it is an
invalid set, the program is ill-formed. If it differs from the result of
a search in T for M in a complete-class context [class.mem] of T, the
program is ill-formed, no diagnostic required.

\[*Example 1*:

``` cpp
struct A { int x; };                    // S(x,A) = \{ \{ A::x \}, \{ A \} \}
struct B { float x; };                  // S(x,B) = \{ \{ B::x \}, \{ B \} \}
struct C: public A, public B { };       // S(x,C) = \{ invalid, \{ A in C, B in C \} \}
struct D: public virtual C { };         // S(x,D) = S(x,C)
struct E: public virtual C { char x; }; // S(x,E) = \{ \{ E::x \}, \{ E \} \}
struct F: public D, public E { };       // S(x,F) = S(x,E)
int main() {
  F f;
  f.x = 0;                              // OK, lookup finds E::x
}
```

$S(\tcode{x},\tcode{F})$ is unambiguous because the `A` and `B` base
class subobjects of `D` are also base class subobjects of `E`, so
$S(\tcode{x},\tcode{D})$ is discarded in the first merge step.

— *end example*\]

If M is a non-dependent *conversion-function-id*, conversion function
templates that are members of T are considered. For each such template
F, the lookup set S(t,T) is constructed, considering a function template
declaration to have the name t only if it corresponds to a declaration
of F [basic.scope.scope]. The members of the declaration set of each
such lookup set, which shall not be an invalid set, are included in the
result.

\[*Note 6*: Overload resolution will discard those that cannot convert
to the type specified by M [temp.over]. — *end note*\]

\[*Note 7*: A static member, a nested type or an enumerator defined in a
base class `T` can unambiguously be found even if an object has more
than one base class subobject of type `T`. Two base class subobjects
share the non-static member subobjects of their common virtual base
classes. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 2*:

``` cpp
struct V {
  int v;
};
struct A {
  int a;
  static int s;
  enum { e };
};
struct B : A, virtual V { };
struct C : A, virtual V { };
struct D : B, C { };

void f(D* pd) {
  pd->v++;          // OK, only one v (virtual)
  pd->s++;          // OK, only one s (static)
  int i = pd->e;    // OK, only one e (enumerator)
  pd->a++;          // error: ambiguous: two a{s} in D
}
```

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 8*:  When virtual base classes are used, a hidden declaration
can be reached along a path through the subobject lattice that does not
pass through the hiding declaration. This is not an ambiguity. The
identical use with non-virtual base classes is an ambiguity; in that
case there is no unique instance of the name that hides all the
others. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 3*:

``` cpp
struct V { int f();  int x; };
struct W { int g();  int y; };
struct B : virtual V, W {
  int f();  int x;
  int g();  int y;
};
struct C : virtual V, W { };

struct D : B, C { void glorp(); };
```

As illustrated in , the names declared in `V` and the left-hand instance
of `W` are hidden by those in `B`, but the names declared in the
right-hand instance of `W` are not hidden at all.

``` cpp
void D::glorp() {
  x++;              // OK, B::x hides V::x
  f();              // OK, B::f() hides V::f()
  y++;              // error: B::y and C's W::y
  g();              // error: B::g() and C's W::g()
}
```

— *end example*\]

An explicit or implicit conversion from a pointer to or an expression
designating an object of a derived class to a pointer or reference to
one of its base classes shall unambiguously refer to a unique object
representing the base class.

\[*Example 4*:

``` cpp
struct V { };
struct A { };
struct B : A, virtual V { };
struct C : A, virtual V { };
struct D : B, C { };

void g() {
  D d;
  B* pb = &d;
  A* pa = &d;       // error: ambiguous: C's A or B's A?
  V* pv = &d;       // OK, only one V subobject
}
```

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 9*: Even if the result of name lookup is unambiguous, use of a
name found in multiple subobjects might still be ambiguous
[conv.mem], [expr.ref], [class.access.base]. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 5*:

``` cpp
struct B1 {
  void f();
  static void f(int);
  int i;
};
struct B2 {
  void f(double);
};
struct I1: B1 { };
struct I2: B1 { };

struct D: I1, I2, B2 {
  using B1::f;
  using B2::f;
  void g() {
    f();                        // Ambiguous conversion of this
    f(0);                       // Unambiguous (static)
    f(0.0);                     // Unambiguous (only one B2)
    int B1::* mpB1 = &D::i;     // Unambiguous
    int D::* mpD = &D::i;       // Ambiguous conversion
  }
};
```

— *end example*\]

### Unqualified name lookup <a id="basic.lookup.unqual">[basic.lookup.unqual]</a>

A *using-directive* is *active* in a scope S at a program point P if it
precedes P and inhabits either S or the scope of a namespace nominated
by a *using-directive* that is active in S at P.

An *unqualified search* in a scope S from a program point P includes the
results of searches from P in

- S, and

- for any scope U that contains P and is or is contained by S, each
  namespace contained by S that is nominated by a *using-directive* that
  is active in U at P.

If no declarations are found, the results of the unqualified search are
the results of an unqualified search in the parent scope of S, if any,
from P.

\[*Note 10*: When a class scope is searched, the scopes of its base
classes are also searched [class.member.lookup]. If it inherits from a
single base, it is as if the scope of the base immediately contains the
scope of the derived class. Template parameter scopes that are
associated with one scope in the chain of parents are also considered
[temp.local]. — *end note*\]

*Unqualified name lookup*

from a program point performs an unqualified search in its immediate
scope.

An *unqualified name* is a name that does not immediately follow a
*nested-name-specifier* or the `.` or `->` in a class member access
expression [expr.ref], possibly after a `template` keyword or `~`.
Unless otherwise specified, such a name undergoes unqualified name
lookup from the point where it appears.

An unqualified name that is a component name [expr.prim.id.unqual] of a
*type-specifier* or *ptr-operator* of a *conversion-type-id* is looked
up in the same fashion as the *conversion-function-id* in which it
appears. If that lookup finds nothing, it undergoes unqualified name
lookup; in each case, only names that denote types or templates whose
specializations are types are considered.

\[*Example 6*:

``` cpp
struct T1 { struct U { int i; }; };
struct T2 { };
struct U1 {};
struct U2 {};

struct B {
  using T = T1;
  using U = U1;
  operator U1 T1::*();
  operator U1 T2::*();
  operator U2 T1::*();

In a friend declaration *declarator* whose *declarator-id* is a
*qualified-id* whose lookup context [basic.lookup.qual] is a class or
namespace S, lookup for an unqualified name that appears after the
*declarator-id* performs a search in the scope associated with S. If
that lookup finds nothing, it undergoes unqualified name lookup.

\[*Example 7*:

``` cpp
using I = int;
using D = double;
namespace A {
  inline namespace N {using C = char; }
  using F = float;
  void f(I);
  void f(D);
  void f(C);
  void f(F);
}
struct X0 {using F = float; };
struct W {
  using D = void;
  struct X : X0 {
    void g(I);
    void g(::D);
    void g(F);
  };
};
namespace B {
  typedef short I, F;
  class Y {
    friend void A::f(I);        // error: no void A::f(short)
    friend void A::f(D);        // OK

### Argument-dependent name lookup <a id="basic.lookup.argdep">[basic.lookup.argdep]</a>

When the *postfix-expression* in a function call [expr.call] is an
*unqualified-id*, and unqualified lookup [basic.lookup.unqual] for the
name in the *unqualified-id* does not find any

- declaration of a class member, or

- function declaration inhabiting a block scope, or

- declaration not of a function or function template

then lookup for the name also includes the result of
*argument-dependent lookup* in a set of associated namespaces that
depends on the types of the arguments (and for template template
arguments, the namespace of the template argument), as specified below.

\[*Example 8*:

``` cpp
namespace N {
  struct S { };
  void f(S);
}

void g() {
  N::S s;
  f(s);             // OK, calls N::f
  (f)(s);           // error: N::f not considered; parentheses prevent argument-dependent lookup
}
```

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 11*:

For purposes of determining (during parsing) whether an expression is a
*postfix-expression* for a function call, the usual name lookup rules
apply. In some cases a name followed by `<` is treated as a
*template-name* even though name lookup did not find a *template-name*
(see [temp.names]). For example,

``` cpp
int h;
void g();
namespace N {
  struct A {};
  template <class T> int f(T);
  template <class T> int g(T);
  template <class T> int h(T);
}

int x = f<N::A>(N::A());        // OK, lookup of f finds nothing, f treated as template name
int y = g<N::A>(N::A());        // OK, lookup of g finds a function, g treated as template name
int z = h<N::A>(N::A());        // error: h< does not begin a template-id
```

The rules have no effect on the syntactic interpretation of an
expression. For example,

``` cpp
typedef int f;
namespace N {
  struct A {
    friend void f(A &);
    operator int();
    void g(A a) {
      int i = f(a);             // f is the typedef, not the friend function: equivalent to int(a)
    }
  };
}
```

Because the expression is not a function call, argument-dependent name
lookup does not apply and the friend function `f` is not found.

— *end note*\]

For each argument type `T` in the function call, there is a set of zero
or more *associated entities* to be considered. The set of entities is
determined entirely by the types of the function arguments (and any
template template arguments). Any *typedef-name*s and
*using-declaration* used to specify the types do not contribute to this
set. The set of entities is determined in the following way:

- If `T` is a fundamental type, its associated set of entities is empty.

- If `T` is a class type (including unions), its associated entities
  are: the class itself; the class of which it is a member, if any; and
  its direct and indirect base classes. Furthermore, if `T` is a class
  template specialization, its associated entities also include: the
  entities associated with the types of the template arguments provided
  for template type parameters; the templates used as template template
  arguments; and the classes of which any member templates used as
  template template arguments are members.

  \[*Note 4*: Non-type template arguments do not contribute to the set
  of associated entities. — *end note*\]

- If `T` is an enumeration type, its associated entities are `T` and, if
  it is a class member, the member’s class.

- If `T` is a pointer to `U` or an array of `U`, its associated entities
  are those associated with `U`.

- If `T` is a function type, its associated entities are those
  associated with the function parameter types and those associated with
  the return type.

- If `T` is a pointer to a member function of a class `X`, its
  associated entities are those associated with the function parameter
  types and return type, together with those associated with `X`.

- If `T` is a pointer to a data member of class `X`, its associated
  entities are those associated with the member type together with those
  associated with `X`.

In addition, if the argument is an overload set or the address of such a
set, its associated entities are the union of those associated with each
of the members of the set, i.e., the entities associated with its
parameter types and return type. Additionally, if the aforementioned
overload set is named with a *template-id*, its associated entities also
include its template *template-argument* and those associated with its
type *template-argument*s.

The *associated namespaces* for a call are the innermost enclosing
non-inline namespaces for its associated entities as well as every
element of the inline namespace set [namespace.def] of those namespaces.
Argument-dependent lookup finds all declarations of functions and
function templates that

- are found by a search of any associated namespace, or

- are declared as a friend [class.friend] of any class with a reachable
  definition in the set of associated entities, or

- are exported, are attached to a named module `M` [module.interface],
  do not appear in the translation unit containing the point of the
  lookup, and have the same innermost enclosing non-inline namespace
  scope as a declaration of an associated entity attached to `M`
  [basic.link].

If the lookup is for a dependent name [temp.dep], [temp.dep.candidate],
the above lookup is also performed from each point in the instantiation
context [module.context] of the lookup, additionally ignoring any
declaration that appears in another translation unit, is attached to the
global module, and is either discarded [module.global.frag] or has
internal linkage.

\[*Example 9*:

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 12*: The associated namespace can include namespaces already
considered by ordinary unqualified lookup. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 10*:

``` cpp
namespace NS {
  class T { };
  void f(T);
  void g(T, int);
}
NS::T parm;
void g(NS::T, float);
int main() {
  f(parm);                      // OK, calls NS::f
  extern void g(NS::T, float);
  g(parm, 1);                   // OK, calls g(NS::T, float)
}

### Qualified name lookup <a id="basic.lookup.qual">[basic.lookup.qual]</a>

#### General <a id="basic.lookup.qual.general">[basic.lookup.qual.general]</a>

Lookup of an *identifier* followed by a `::` scope resolution operator
considers only namespaces, types, and templates whose specializations
are types. If a name, *template-id*, or *decltype-specifier* is followed
by a `::`, it shall designate a namespace, class, enumeration, or
dependent type, and the `::` is never interpreted as a complete
*nested-name-specifier*.

\[*Example 11*:

``` cpp
class A {
public:
  static int n;
};
int main() {
  int A;
  A::n = 42;            // OK
  A b;                  // error: A does not name a type
}
template<int> struct B : A {};
namespace N {
  template<int> void B();
  int f() {
    return B<0>::n;     // error: N::B<0> is not a type
  }
}
```

— *end example*\]

A member-qualified name is the (unique) component name
[expr.prim.id.unqual], if any, of

- an *unqualified-id* or

- a *nested-name-specifier* of the form *type-name* `::` or
  *namespace-name* `::`

in the *id-expression* of a class member access expression [expr.ref]. A
*qualified name* is

- a member-qualified name or

- the terminal name of

  - a *qualified-id*,

  - a *using-declarator*,

  - a *typename-specifier*,

  - a *qualified-namespace-specifier*, or

  - a *nested-name-specifier*, *elaborated-type-specifier*, or
    *class-or-decltype* that has a *nested-name-specifier*
    [expr.prim.id.qual].

The *lookup context* of a member-qualified name is the type of its
associated object expression (considered dependent if the object
expression is type-dependent). The lookup context of any other qualified
name is the type, template, or namespace nominated by the preceding
*nested-name-specifier*.

\[*Note 13*: When parsing a class member access, the name following the
`->` or `.` is a qualified name even though it is not yet known of which
kind. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 12*:

In

``` cpp
  N::C::m.Base::f()
```

`Base` is a member-qualified name; the other qualified names are `C`,
`m`, and `f`.

— *end example*\]

*Qualified name lookup*

in a class, namespace, or enumeration performs a search of the scope
associated with it [class.member.lookup] except as specified below.
Unless otherwise specified, a qualified name undergoes qualified name
lookup in its lookup context from the point where it appears unless the
lookup context either is dependent and is not the current instantiation
[temp.dep.type] or is not a class or class template. If nothing is found
by qualified lookup for a member-qualified name that is the terminal
name [expr.prim.id.unqual] of a *nested-name-specifier* and is not
dependent, it undergoes unqualified lookup.

\[*Note 14*: During lookup for a template specialization, no names are
dependent. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 13*:

``` cpp
int f();
struct A {
  int B, C;
  template<int> using D = void;
  using T = void;
  void f();
};
using B = A;
template<int> using C = A;
template<int> using D = A;
template<int> using X = A;

template<class T>
void g(T *p) {                  // as instantiated for g<A>:
  p->X<0>::f();                 // error: A::X not found in ((p->X) < 0) > ::f()
  p->template X<0>::f();        // OK, ::X found in definition context
  p->B::f();                    // OK, non-type A::B ignored
  p->template C<0>::f();        // error: A::C is not a template
  p->template D<0>::f();        // error: A::D<0> is not a class type
  p->T::f();                    // error: A::T is not a class type
}
template void g(A*);
```

— *end example*\]

If a qualified name Q follows a `~`:

- If Q is a member-qualified name, it undergoes unqualified lookup as
  well as qualified lookup.

- Otherwise, its *nested-name-specifier* N shall nominate a type. If N
  has another *nested-name-specifier* S, Q is looked up as if its lookup
  context were that nominated by S.

- Otherwise, if the terminal name of N is a member-qualified name M, Q
  is looked up as if $\tcode{\~}Q$ appeared in place of M (as above).

- Otherwise, Q undergoes unqualified lookup.

- Each lookup for Q considers only types (if Q is not followed by a `<`)
  and templates whose specializations are types. If it finds nothing or
  is ambiguous, it is discarded.

- The *type-name* that is or contains Q shall refer to its (original)
  lookup context (ignoring cv-qualification) under the interpretation
  established by at least one (successful) lookup performed.

\[*Example 14*:

``` cpp
struct C {
  typedef int I;
};
typedef int I1, I2;
extern int* p;
extern int* q;
void f() {
  p->C::I::~I();        // I is looked up in the scope of C
  q->I1::~I2();         // I2 is found by unqualified lookup
}
struct A {
  ~A();
};
typedef A AB;
int main() {
  AB* p;
  p->AB::~AB();         // explicitly calls the destructor for A
}
```

— *end example*\]

#### Class members <a id="class.qual">[class.qual]</a>

In a lookup for a qualified name N whose lookup context is a class C in
which function names are not ignored,

- if the search finds the injected-class-name of `C` [class.pre], or

- if N is dependent and is the terminal name of a *using-declarator*
  [namespace.udecl] that names a constructor,

N is instead considered to name the constructor of class `C`. Such a
constructor name shall be used only in the *declarator-id* of a (friend)
declaration of a constructor or in a *using-declaration*.

\[*Example 15*:

``` cpp
struct A { A(); };
struct B: public A { B(); };

A::A() { }
B::B() { }

B::A ba;            // object of type A
A::A a;             // error: A::A is not a type name
struct A::A a2;     // object of type A
```

— *end example*\]

#### Namespace members <a id="namespace.qual">[namespace.qual]</a>

Qualified name lookup in a namespace N additionally searches every
element of the inline namespace set of N [namespace.def]. If nothing is
found, the results of the lookup are the results of qualified name
lookup in each namespace nominated by a *using-directive* that precedes
the point of the lookup and inhabits N or an element of N’s inline
namespace set.

\[*Note 15*: If a *using-directive* refers to a namespace that has
already been considered, it does not affect the result. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 16*:

``` cpp
int x;
namespace Y {
  void f(float);
  void h(int);
}

namespace Z {
  void h(double);
}

namespace A {
  using namespace Y;
  void f(int);
  void g(int);
  int i;
}

namespace B {
  using namespace Z;
  void f(char);
  int i;
}

namespace AB {
  using namespace A;
  using namespace B;
  void g();
}

void h()
{
  AB::g();          // g is declared directly in AB, therefore S is $\{ AB::g() \}$ and AB::g() is chosen

  AB::f(1);         // f is not declared directly in AB so the rules are applied recursively to A and B;
                    // namespace Y is not searched and Y::f(float) is not considered;
                    // S is $\{ A::f(int), B::f(char) \}$ and overload resolution chooses A::f(int)

  AB::f('c');       // as above but resolution chooses B::f(char)

  AB::x++;          // x is not declared directly in AB, and is not declared in A or B, so the rules
                    // are applied recursively to Y and Z, S is $\{ \}$ so the program is ill-formed

  AB::i++;          // i is not declared directly in AB so the rules are applied recursively to A and B,
                    // S is $\{ A::i, B::i \}$ so the use is ambiguous and the program is ill-formed

  AB::h(16.8);      // h is not declared directly in AB and not declared directly in A or B so the rules
                    // are applied recursively to Y and Z, S is $\{ Y::h(int), Z::h(double) \}$ and
                    // overload resolution chooses Z::h(double)
}
```

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 16*:

The same declaration found more than once is not an ambiguity (because
it is still a unique declaration).

— *end note*\]

\[*Example 17*:

Because each referenced namespace is searched at most once, the
following is well-defined:

``` cpp
namespace B {
  int b;
}

namespace A {
  using namespace B;
  int a;
}

namespace B {
  using namespace A;
}

void f()
{
  A::a++;           // OK, a declared directly in A, S is $\{ A::a \}$
  B::a++;           // OK, both A and B searched (once), S is $\{ A::a \}$
  A::b++;           // OK, both A and B searched (once), S is $\{ B::b \}$
  B::b++;           // OK, b declared directly in B, S is $\{ B::b \}$
}
```

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 17*: Class and enumeration declarations are not discarded
because of other declarations found in other searches. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 18*:

``` cpp
namespace A {
  struct x { };
  int x;
  int y;
}

namespace B {
  struct y { };
}

namespace C {
  using namespace A;
  using namespace B;
  int i = C::x;     // OK, A::x (of type int)
  int j = C::y;     // ambiguous, A::y or B::y
}
```

— *end example*\]

### Elaborated type specifiers <a id="basic.lookup.elab">[basic.lookup.elab]</a>

If the *class-key* or `enum` keyword in an *elaborated-type-specifier*
is followed by an *identifier* that is not followed by `::`, lookup for
the *identifier* is type-only [basic.lookup.general].

\[*Note 18*: In general, the recognition of an
*elaborated-type-specifier* depends on the following tokens. If the
*identifier* is followed by `::`, see
[basic.lookup.qual]. — *end note*\]

If the terminal name of the *elaborated-type-specifier* is a qualified
name, lookup for it is type-only. If the name lookup does not find a
previously declared *type-name*, the *elaborated-type-specifier* is
ill-formed.

\[*Example 19*:

``` cpp
struct Node {
  struct Node* Next;            // OK, refers to injected-class-name Node
  struct Data* Data;            // OK, declares type Data at global scope and member Data
};

struct Data {
  struct Node* Node;            // OK, refers to Node at global scope
  friend struct ::Glob;         // error: Glob is not declared, cannot introduce a qualified type[dcl.type.elab]
  friend struct Glob;           // OK, refers to (as yet) undeclared Glob at global scope.
  ...
};

struct Base {
  struct Data;                  // OK, declares nested Data
  struct ::Data*     thatData;  // OK, refers to ::Data
  struct Base::Data* thisData;  // OK, refers to nested Data
  friend class ::Data;          // OK, global Data is a friend
  friend class Data;            // OK, nested Data is a friend
  struct Data { ... };    // Defines nested Data
};

struct Data;                    // OK, redeclares Data at global scope
struct ::Data;                  // error: cannot introduce a qualified type[dcl.type.elab]
struct Base::Data;              // error: cannot introduce a qualified type[dcl.type.elab]
struct Base::Datum;             // error: Datum undefined
struct Base::Data* pBase;       // OK, refers to nested Data
```

— *end example*\]

### Using-directives and namespace aliases <a id="basic.lookup.udir">[basic.lookup.udir]</a>

In a *using-directive* or *namespace-alias-definition*, during the
lookup for a *namespace-name* or for a name in a *nested-name-specifier*
only namespace names are considered.

## Program and linkage <a id="basic.link">[basic.link]</a>

A *program* consists of one or more translation units [lex.separate]
linked together. A translation unit consists of a sequence of
declarations.

``` bnf
translation-unit:
    [declaration-seq]
    [global-module-fragment] module-declaration [declaration-seq] [private-module-fragment]
```

A name is said to have *linkage* when it can denote the same object,
reference, function, type, template, namespace or value as a name
introduced by a declaration in another scope:

- When a name has *external linkage*, the entity it denotes can be
  referred to by names from scopes of other translation units or from
  other scopes of the same translation unit.

- When a name has *module linkage*, the entity it denotes can be
  referred to by names from other scopes of the same module unit
  [module.unit] or from scopes of other module units of that same
  module.

- When a name has *internal linkage*, the entity it denotes can be
  referred to by names from other scopes in the same translation unit.

- When a name has *no linkage*, the entity it denotes cannot be referred
  to by names from other scopes.

The name of an entity that belongs to a namespace scope
[basic.scope.namespace] has internal linkage if it is the name of

- a variable, variable template, function, or function template that is
  explicitly declared `static`; or

- a non-template variable of non-volatile const-qualified type, unless

  - it is declared in the purview of a module interface unit (outside
    the *private-module-fragment*, if any) or module partition, or

  - it is explicitly declared `extern`, or

  - it is inline, or

  - it was previously declared and the prior declaration did not have
    internal linkage; or

- a data member of an anonymous union.

\[*Note 1*: An instantiated variable template that has const-qualified
type can have external or module linkage, even if not declared
`extern`. — *end note*\]

An unnamed namespace or a namespace declared directly or indirectly
within an unnamed namespace has internal linkage. All other namespaces
have external linkage. The name of an entity that belongs to a namespace
scope that has not been given internal linkage above and that is the
name of

- a variable; or

- a function; or

-  a named class [class.pre], or an unnamed class defined in a typedef
  declaration in which the class has the typedef name for linkage
  purposes [dcl.typedef]; or

-  a named enumeration [dcl.enum], or an unnamed enumeration defined in
  a typedef declaration in which the enumeration has the typedef name
  for linkage purposes [dcl.typedef]; or

- an unnamed enumeration that has an enumerator as a name for linkage
  purposes [dcl.enum]; or

- a template

has its linkage determined as follows:

- if the enclosing namespace has internal linkage, the name has internal
  linkage;

- otherwise, if the declaration of the name is attached to a named
  module [module.unit] and is not exported [module.interface], the name
  has module linkage;

- otherwise, the name has external linkage.

In addition, a member function, a static data member, a named class or
enumeration that inhabits a class scope, or an unnamed class or
enumeration defined in a typedef declaration that inhabits a class scope
such that the class or enumeration has the typedef name for linkage
purposes [dcl.typedef], has the same linkage, if any, as the name of the
class of which it is a member.

\[*Example 1*:

``` cpp
static void f();
extern "C" void h();
static int i = 0;               // \#1
void q() {
  extern void f();              // internal linkage
  extern void g();              // ::g, external linkage
  extern void h();              // C language linkage
  int i;                        // \#2: i has no linkage
  {
    extern void f();            // internal linkage
    extern int i;               // \#3: internal linkage
  }
}
```

Even though the declaration at line \#2 hides the declaration at line
\#1, the declaration at line \#3 still redeclares \#1 and receives
internal linkage.

— *end example*\]

Names not covered by these rules have no linkage. Moreover, except as
noted, a name declared at block scope [basic.scope.block] has no
linkage.

Two declarations of entities declare the same entity if, considering
declarations of unnamed types to introduce their names for linkage
purposes, if any [dcl.typedef], [dcl.enum], they correspond
[basic.scope.scope], have the same target scope that is not a function
or template parameter scope, and either

- they appear in the same translation unit, or

- they both declare names with module linkage and are attached to the
  same module, or

- they both declare names with external linkage.

\[*Note 2*: There are other circumstances in which declarations declare
the same entity
[dcl.link], [temp.type], [temp.spec.partial]. — *end note*\]

If a declaration H that declares a name with internal linkage precedes a
declaration D in another translation unit U and would declare the same
entity as D if it appeared in U, the program is ill-formed.

\[*Note 3*: Such an H can appear only in a header unit. — *end note*\]

If two declarations of an entity are attached to different modules, the
program is ill-formed; no diagnostic is required if neither is reachable
from the other.

\[*Example 2*:

— *end example*\]

As a consequence of these rules, all declarations of an entity are
attached to the same module; the entity is said to be *attached* to that
module.

For any two declarations of an entity E:

- If one declares E to be a variable or function, the other shall
  declare E as one of the same type.

- If one declares E to be an enumerator, the other shall do so.

- If one declares E to be a namespace, the other shall do so.

- If one declares E to be a type, the other shall declare E to be a type
  of the same kind [dcl.type.elab].

- If one declares E to be a class template, the other shall do so with
  the same kind and an equivalent *template-head* [temp.over.link].

  \[*Note 5*: The declarations can supply different default template
  arguments. — *end note*\]

- If one declares E to be a function template or a (partial
  specialization of a) variable template, the other shall declare E to
  be one with an equivalent *template-head* and type.

- If one declares E to be an alias template, the other shall declare E
  to be one with an equivalent *template-head* and *defining-type-id*.

- If one declares E to be a concept, the other shall do so.

Types are compared after all adjustments of types (during which typedefs
[dcl.typedef] are replaced by their definitions); declarations for an
array object can specify array types that differ by the presence or
absence of a major array bound [dcl.array]. No diagnostic is required if
neither declaration is reachable from the other.

\[*Example 3*:

``` cpp
int f(int x, int x);    // error: different entities for x
void g();               // \#1
void g(int);            // OK, different entity from \#1
int g();                // error: same entity as \#1 with different type
void h();               // \#2
namespace h {}          // error: same entity as \#2, but not a function
```

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 4*: Linkage to non-C++ declarations can be achieved using a
*linkage-specification* [dcl.link]. — *end note*\]

A declaration D *names* an entity E if

- D contains a *lambda-expression* whose closure type is E,

- E is not a function or function template and D contains an
  *id-expression*, *type-specifier*, *nested-name-specifier*,
  *template-name*, or *concept-name* denoting E, or

- E is a function or function template and D contains an expression that
  names E [basic.def.odr] or an *id-expression* that refers to a set of
  overloads that contains E.

  \[*Note 6*: Non-dependent names in an instantiated declaration do not
  refer to a set of overloads [temp.res]. — *end note*\]

A declaration is an *exposure* if it either names a TU-local entity
(defined below), ignoring

- the *function-body* for a non-inline function or function template
  (but not the deduced return type for a (possibly instantiated)
  definition of a function with a declared return type that uses a
  placeholder type [dcl.spec.auto]),

- the *initializer* for a variable or variable template (but not the
  variable’s type),

- friend declarations in a class definition, and

- any reference to a non-volatile const object or reference with
  internal or no linkage initialized with a constant expression that is
  not an odr-use [term.odr.use],

or defines a constexpr variable initialized to a TU-local value (defined
below).

\[*Note 5*: An inline function template can be an exposure even though
certain explicit specializations of it would be usable in other
translation units. — *end note*\]

An entity is *TU-local* if it is

- a type, function, variable, or template that

  - has a name with internal linkage, or

  - does not have a name with linkage and is declared, or introduced by
    a *lambda-expression*, within the definition of a TU-local entity,

- a type with no name that is defined outside a *class-specifier*,
  function body, or *initializer* or is introduced by a
  *defining-type-specifier* that is used to declare only TU-local
  entities,

- a specialization of a TU-local template,

- a specialization of a template with any TU-local template argument, or

- a specialization of a template whose (possibly instantiated)
  declaration is an exposure.

  \[*Note 7*: A specialization can be produced by implicit or explicit
  instantiation. — *end note*\]

A value or object is *TU-local* if either

- it is, or is a pointer to, a TU-local function or the object
  associated with a TU-local variable, or

- it is an object of class or array type and any of its subobjects or
  any of the objects or functions to which its non-static data members
  of reference type refer is TU-local and is usable in constant
  expressions.

If a (possibly instantiated) declaration of, or a deduction guide for, a
non-TU-local entity in a module interface unit (outside the
*private-module-fragment*, if any) or module partition [module.unit] is
an exposure, the program is ill-formed. Such a declaration in any other
context is deprecated [depr.local].

If a declaration that appears in one translation unit names a TU-local
entity declared in another translation unit that is not a header unit,
the program is ill-formed. A declaration instantiated for a template
specialization [temp.spec] appears at the point of instantiation of the
specialization [temp.point].

## Memory and objects <a id="basic.memobj">[basic.memobj]</a>

### Memory model <a id="intro.memory">[intro.memory]</a>

The fundamental storage unit in the C++ memory model is the *byte*. A
byte is at least large enough to contain the ordinary literal encoding
of any element of the basic literal character set [lex.charset] and the
eight-bit code units of the Unicode

UTF-8 encoding form and is composed of a contiguous sequence of bits,

the number of which is *implementation-defined*. The least significant
bit is called the *low-order bit*; the most significant bit is called
the *high-order bit*. The memory available to a C++ program consists of
one or more sequences of contiguous bytes. Every byte has a unique
address.

\[*Note 1*: The representation of types is described in 
[basic.types.general]. — *end note*\]

A *memory location* is either an object of scalar type that is not a
bit-field or a maximal sequence of adjacent bit-fields all having
nonzero width.

\[*Note 2*: Various features of the language, such as references and
virtual functions, might involve additional memory locations that are
not accessible to programs but are managed by the
implementation. — *end note*\]

Two or more threads of execution [intro.multithread] can access separate
memory locations without interfering with each other.

\[*Note 3*: Thus a bit-field and an adjacent non-bit-field are in
separate memory locations, and therefore can be concurrently updated by
two threads of execution without interference. The same applies to two
bit-fields, if one is declared inside a nested struct declaration and
the other is not, or if the two are separated by a zero-length bit-field
declaration, or if they are separated by a non-bit-field declaration. It
is not safe to concurrently update two bit-fields in the same struct if
all fields between them are also bit-fields of nonzero
width. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 1*:

A class declared as

``` cpp
struct {
  char a;
  int b:5,
  c:11,
  :0,
  d:8;
  struct {int ee:8;} e;
};
```

contains four separate memory locations: The member `a` and bit-fields
`d` and `e.ee` are each separate memory locations, and can be modified
concurrently without interfering with each other. The bit-fields `b` and
`c` together constitute the fourth memory location. The bit-fields `b`
and `c` cannot be concurrently modified, but `b` and `a`, for example,
can be.

— *end example*\]

### Object model <a id="intro.object">[intro.object]</a>

The constructs in a C++ program create, destroy, refer to, access, and
manipulate objects. An *object* is created by a definition [basic.def],
by a *new-expression* [expr.new], by an operation that implicitly
creates objects (see below), when implicitly changing the active member
of a union [class.union], or when a temporary object is created
[conv.rval], [class.temporary]. An object occupies a region of storage
in its period of construction [class.cdtor], throughout its lifetime
[basic.life], and in its period of destruction [class.cdtor].

\[*Note 4*: A function is not an object, regardless of whether or not it
occupies storage in the way that objects do. — *end note*\]

The properties of an object are determined when the object is created.
An object can have a name [basic.pre]. An object has a storage duration
[basic.stc] which influences its lifetime [basic.life]. An object has a
type [basic.types].

\[*Note 5*: Some objects are polymorphic [class.virtual]; the
implementation generates information associated with each such object
that makes it possible to determine that object’s type during program
execution. — *end note*\]

Objects can contain other objects, called *subobjects*. A subobject can
be a *member subobject* [class.mem], a *base class subobject*
[class.derived], or an array element. An object that is not a subobject
of any other object is called a *complete
object*. If an object is created in storage associated with a member
subobject or array element *e* (which may or may not be within its
lifetime), the created object is a subobject of *e*’s containing object
if:

- the lifetime of *e*’s containing object has begun and not ended, and

- the storage for the new object exactly overlays the storage location
  associated with *e*, and

- the new object is of the same type as *e* (ignoring cv-qualification).

If a complete object is created [expr.new] in storage associated with
another object *e* of type “array of N `unsigned char`” or of type
“array of N `std::byte`” [cstddef.syn], that array *provides storage*
for the created object if:

- the lifetime of *e* has begun and not ended, and

- the storage for the new object fits entirely within *e*, and

- there is no array object that satisfies these constraints nested
  within *e*.

\[*Note 6*: If that portion of the array previously provided storage for
another object, the lifetime of that object ends because its storage was
reused [basic.life]. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 2*:

``` cpp
template<typename ...T>
struct AlignedUnion {
  alignas(T...) unsigned char data[max(sizeof(T)...)];
};
int f() {
  AlignedUnion<int, char> au;
  int *p = new (au.data) int;           // OK, au.data provides storage
  char *c = new (au.data) char();       // OK, ends lifetime of *p
  char *d = new (au.data + 1) char();
  return *c + *d;                       // OK
}

struct A { unsigned char a[32]; };
struct B { unsigned char b[16]; };
A a;
B *b = new (a.a + 8) B;                 // a.a provides storage for *b
int *p = new (b->b + 4) int;            // b->b provides storage for *p
                                        // a.a does not provide storage for *p (directly),
                                        // but *p is nested within a (see below)
```

— *end example*\]

An object *a* is *nested within* another object *b* if:

- *a* is a subobject of *b*, or

- *b* provides storage for *a*, or

- there exists an object *c* where *a* is nested within *c*, and *c* is
  nested within *b*.

For every object `x`, there is some object called the
*complete object of* `x`, determined as follows:

- If `x` is a complete object, then the complete object of `x` is
  itself.

- Otherwise, the complete object of `x` is the complete object of the
  (unique) object that contains `x`.

If a complete object, a member subobject, or an array element is of
class type, its type is considered the *most derived
class*, to distinguish it from the class type of any base class
subobject; an object of a most derived class type or of a non-class type
is called a *most derived object*.

A *potentially-overlapping subobject* is either:

- a base class subobject, or

- a non-static data member declared with the `no_unique_address`
  attribute [dcl.attr.nouniqueaddr].

An object has nonzero size if it

- is not a potentially-overlapping subobject, or

- is not of class type, or

- is of a class type with virtual member functions or virtual base
  classes, or

- has subobjects of nonzero size or unnamed bit-fields of nonzero
  length.

Otherwise, if the object is a base class subobject of a standard-layout
class type with no non-static data members, it has zero size. Otherwise,
the circumstances under which the object has zero size are
*implementation-defined*. Unless it is a bit-field [class.bit], an
object with nonzero size shall occupy one or more bytes of storage,
including every byte that is occupied in full or in part by any of its
subobjects. An object of trivially copyable or standard-layout type
[basic.types.general] shall occupy contiguous bytes of storage.

Unless an object is a bit-field or a subobject of zero size, the address
of that object is the address of the first byte it occupies. Two objects
with overlapping lifetimes that are not bit-fields may have the same
address if one is nested within the other, or if at least one is a
subobject of zero size and they are of different types; otherwise, they
have distinct addresses and occupy disjoint bytes of storage.

\[*Example 3*:

``` cpp
static const char test1 = 'x';
static const char test2 = 'x';
const bool b = &test1 != &test2;        // always true
```

— *end example*\]

The address of a non-bit-field subobject of zero size is the address of
an unspecified byte of storage occupied by the complete object of that
subobject.

Some operations are described as *implicitly creating objects* within a
specified region of storage. For each operation that is specified as
implicitly creating objects, that operation implicitly creates and
starts the lifetime of zero or more objects of implicit-lifetime types
[basic.types.general] in its specified region of storage if doing so
would result in the program having defined behavior. If no such set of
objects would give the program defined behavior, the behavior of the
program is undefined. If multiple such sets of objects would give the
program defined behavior, it is unspecified which such set of objects is
created.

\[*Note 7*: Such operations do not start the lifetimes of subobjects of
such objects that are not themselves of implicit-lifetime
types. — *end note*\]

Further, after implicitly creating objects within a specified region of
storage, some operations are described as producing a pointer to a
*suitable created object*. These operations select one of the
implicitly-created objects whose address is the address of the start of
the region of storage, and produce a pointer value that points to that
object, if that value would result in the program having defined
behavior. If no such pointer value would give the program defined
behavior, the behavior of the program is undefined. If multiple such
pointer values would give the program defined behavior, it is
unspecified which such pointer value is produced.

\[*Example 4*:

``` cpp
#include <cstdlib>
struct X { int a, b; };
X *make_x() {
  // The call to std::malloc implicitly creates an object of type X
  // and its subobjects a and b, and returns a pointer to that X object
  // (or an object that is pointer-interconvertible[basic.compound] with it),
  // in order to give the subsequent class member access operations
  // defined behavior.
  X *p = (X*)std::malloc(sizeof(struct X));
  p->a = 1;
  p->b = 2;
  return p;
}
```

— *end example*\]

An operation that begins the lifetime of an array of `unsigned char` or
`std::byte` implicitly creates objects within the region of storage
occupied by the array.

\[*Note 8*: The array object provides storage for these
objects. — *end note*\]

Any implicit or explicit invocation of a function named `operator new`
or `operator new[]` implicitly creates objects in the returned region of
storage and returns a pointer to a suitable created object.

\[*Note 9*: Some functions in the C++ standard library implicitly create
objects
[obj.lifetime], [allocator.traits.members], [c.malloc], [cstring.syn], [bit.cast]. — *end note*\]

### Lifetime <a id="basic.life">[basic.life]</a>

The *lifetime* of an object or reference is a runtime property of the
object or reference. A variable is said to have *vacuous initialization*
if it is default-initialized and, if it is of class type or a (possibly
multidimensional) array thereof, that class type has a trivial default
constructor. The lifetime of an object of type `T` begins when:

- storage with the proper alignment and size for type `T` is obtained,
  and

- its initialization (if any) is complete (including vacuous
  initialization) [dcl.init],

except that if the object is a union member or subobject thereof, its
lifetime only begins if that union member is the initialized member in
the union [dcl.init.aggr], [class.base.init], or as described in
[class.union], [class.copy.ctor], and [class.copy.assign], and except as
described in [allocator.members]. The lifetime of an object *o* of type
`T` ends when:

- if `T` is a non-class type, the object is destroyed, or

- if `T` is a class type, the destructor call starts, or

- the storage which the object occupies is released, or is reused by an
  object that is not nested within *o* [intro.object].

The lifetime of a reference begins when its initialization is complete.
The lifetime of a reference ends as if it were a scalar object requiring
storage.

\[*Note 10*:  [class.base.init] describes the lifetime of base and
member subobjects. — *end note*\]

The properties ascribed to objects and references throughout this
document apply for a given object or reference only during its lifetime.

\[*Note 11*: In particular, before the lifetime of an object starts and
after its lifetime ends there are significant restrictions on the use of
the object, as described below, in  [class.base.init], and in 
[class.cdtor]. Also, the behavior of an object under construction and
destruction can differ from the behavior of an object whose lifetime has
started and not ended. [class.base.init] and  [class.cdtor] describe the
behavior of an object during its periods of construction and
destruction. — *end note*\]

A program may end the lifetime of an object of class type without
invoking the destructor, by reusing or releasing the storage as
described above.

\[*Note 12*: A *delete-expression* [expr.delete] invokes the destructor
prior to releasing the storage. — *end note*\]

In this case, the destructor is not implicitly invoked.

\[*Note 13*: The correct behavior of a program often depends on the
destructor being invoked for each object of class type. — *end note*\]

Before the lifetime of an object has started but after the storage which
the object will occupy has been allocated

or, after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage
which the object occupied is reused or released, any pointer that
represents the address of the storage location where the object will be
or was located may be used but only in limited ways. For an object under
construction or destruction, see  [class.cdtor]. Otherwise, such a
pointer refers to allocated storage [basic.stc.dynamic.allocation], and
using the pointer as if the pointer were of type `void*` is
well-defined. Indirection through such a pointer is permitted but the
resulting lvalue may only be used in limited ways, as described below.
The program has undefined behavior if:

- the pointer is used as the operand of a *delete-expression*,

- the pointer is used to access a non-static data member or call a
  non-static member function of the object, or

- the pointer is implicitly converted [conv.ptr] to a pointer to a
  virtual base class, or

- the pointer is used as the operand of a `static_cast`
  [expr.static.cast], except when the conversion is to pointer to
  cv `void`, or to pointer to cv `void` and subsequently to pointer to
  cv `char`, cv `unsigned char`, or cv `std::byte` [cstddef.syn], or

- the pointer is used as the operand of a `dynamic_cast`
  [expr.dynamic.cast].

\[*Example 5*:

``` cpp
#include <cstdlib>

struct B {
  virtual void f();
  void mutate();
  virtual ~B();
};

struct D1 : B { void f(); };
struct D2 : B { void f(); };

void B::mutate() {
  new (this) D2;    // reuses storage --- ends the lifetime of *this
  f();              // undefined behavior
  ... = this;       // OK, this points to valid memory
}

void g() {
  void* p = std::malloc(sizeof(D1) + sizeof(D2));
  B* pb = new (p) D1;
  pb->mutate();
  *pb;              // OK, pb points to valid memory
  void* q = pb;     // OK, pb points to valid memory
  pb->f();          // undefined behavior: lifetime of *pb has ended
}
```

— *end example*\]

Similarly, before the lifetime of an object has started but after the
storage which the object will occupy has been allocated or, after the
lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage which the object
occupied is reused or released, any glvalue that refers to the original
object may be used but only in limited ways. For an object under
construction or destruction, see  [class.cdtor]. Otherwise, such a
glvalue refers to allocated storage [basic.stc.dynamic.allocation], and
using the properties of the glvalue that do not depend on its value is
well-defined. The program has undefined behavior if:

- the glvalue is used to access the object, or

- the glvalue is used to call a non-static member function of the
  object, or

- the glvalue is bound to a reference to a virtual base class
  [dcl.init.ref], or

- the glvalue is used as the operand of a `dynamic_cast`
  [expr.dynamic.cast] or as the operand of `typeid`.

If, after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage
which the object occupied is reused or released, a new object is created
at the storage location which the original object occupied, a pointer
that pointed to the original object, a reference that referred to the
original object, or the name of the original object will automatically
refer to the new object and, once the lifetime of the new object has
started, can be used to manipulate the new object, if the original
object is transparently replaceable (see below) by the new object. An
object o₁ is *transparently replaceable* by an object o₂ if:

- the storage that o₂ occupies exactly overlays the storage that o₁
  occupied, and

- o₁ and o₂ are of the same type (ignoring the top-level cv-qualifiers),
  and

- o₁ is not a const, complete object, and

- neither o₁ nor o₂ is a potentially-overlapping subobject
  [intro.object], and

- either o₁ and o₂ are both complete objects, or o₁ and o₂ are direct
  subobjects of objects p₁ and p₂, respectively, and p₁ is transparently
  replaceable by p₂.

\[*Example 6*:

``` cpp
struct C {
  int i;
  void f();
  const C& operator=( const C& );
};

const C& C::operator=( const C& other) {
  if ( this != &other ) {
    this->~C();                 // lifetime of *this ends
    new (this) C(other);        // new object of type C created
    f();                        // well-defined
  }
  return *this;
}

C c1;
C c2;
c1 = c2;                        // well-defined
c1.f();                         // well-defined; c1 refers to a new object of type C
```

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 14*: If these conditions are not met, a pointer to the new
object can be obtained from a pointer that represents the address of its
storage by calling `std::launder` [ptr.launder]. — *end note*\]

If a program ends the lifetime of an object of type `T` with static
[basic.stc.static], thread [basic.stc.thread], or automatic
[basic.stc.auto] storage duration and if `T` has a non-trivial
destructor,

and another object of the original type does not occupy that same
storage location when the implicit destructor call takes place, the
behavior of the program is undefined. This is true even if the block is
exited with an exception.

\[*Example 7*:

``` cpp
class T { };
struct B {
   ~B();
};

void h() {
   B b;
   new (&b) T;
}                               // undefined behavior at block exit
```

— *end example*\]

Creating a new object within the storage that a const, complete object
with static, thread, or automatic storage duration occupies, or within
the storage that such a const object used to occupy before its lifetime
ended, results in undefined behavior.

\[*Example 8*:

``` cpp
struct B {
  B();
  ~B();
};

const B b;

void h() {
  b.~B();
  new (const_cast<B*>(&b)) const B;     // undefined behavior
}
```

— *end example*\]

In this subclause, “before” and “after” refer to the “happens before”
relation [intro.multithread].

\[*Note 15*: Therefore, undefined behavior results if an object that is
being constructed in one thread is referenced from another thread
without adequate synchronization. — *end note*\]

### Indeterminate values <a id="basic.indet">[basic.indet]</a>

When storage for an object with automatic or dynamic storage duration is
obtained, the object has an *indeterminate value*, and if no
initialization is performed for the object, that object retains an
indeterminate value until that value is replaced [expr.ass].

\[*Note 16*: Objects with static or thread storage duration are
zero-initialized, see  [basic.start.static]. — *end note*\]

If an indeterminate value is produced by an evaluation, the behavior is
undefined except in the following cases:

- If an indeterminate value of unsigned ordinary character type
  [basic.fundamental] or `std::byte` type [cstddef.syn] is produced by
  the evaluation of:

  - the second or third operand of a conditional expression [expr.cond],

  - the right operand of a comma expression [expr.comma],

  - the operand of a cast or conversion
    [conv.integral], [expr.type.conv], [expr.static.cast], [expr.cast]
    to an unsigned ordinary character type or `std::byte` type
    [cstddef.syn], or

  - a discarded-value expression [expr.context],

  then the result of the operation is an indeterminate value.

- If an indeterminate value of unsigned ordinary character type or
  `std::byte` type is produced by the evaluation of the right operand of
  a simple assignment operator [expr.ass] whose first operand is an
  lvalue of unsigned ordinary character type or `std::byte` type, an
  indeterminate value replaces the value of the object referred to by
  the left operand.

- If an indeterminate value of unsigned ordinary character type is
  produced by the evaluation of the initialization expression when
  initializing an object of unsigned ordinary character type, that
  object is initialized to an indeterminate value.

- If an indeterminate value of unsigned ordinary character type or
  `std::byte` type is produced by the evaluation of the initialization
  expression when initializing an object of `std::byte` type, that
  object is initialized to an indeterminate value.

\[*Example 9*:

``` cpp
int f(bool b) {
  unsigned char c;
  unsigned char d = c;          // OK, d has an indeterminate value
  int e = d;                    // undefined behavior
  return b ? d : 0;             // undefined behavior if b is true
}
```

— *end example*\]

### Storage duration <a id="basic.stc">[basic.stc]</a>

#### General <a id="basic.stc.general">[basic.stc.general]</a>

The *storage duration* is the property of an object that defines the
minimum potential lifetime of the storage containing the object. The
storage duration is determined by the construct used to create the
object and is one of the following:

- static storage duration

- thread storage duration

- automatic storage duration

- dynamic storage duration

Static, thread, and automatic storage durations are associated with
objects introduced by declarations [basic.def] and implicitly created by
the implementation [class.temporary]. The dynamic storage duration is
associated with objects created by a *new-expression* [expr.new].

The storage duration categories apply to references as well.

When the end of the duration of a region of storage is reached, the
values of all pointers representing the address of any part of that
region of storage become invalid pointer values [basic.compound].
Indirection through an invalid pointer value and passing an invalid
pointer value to a deallocation function have undefined behavior. Any
other use of an invalid pointer value has *implementation-defined*
behavior.

#### Static storage duration <a id="basic.stc.static">[basic.stc.static]</a>

All variables which

- do not have thread storage duration and

- belong to a namespace scope [basic.scope.namespace] or are first
  declared with the `static` or `extern` keywords [dcl.stc]

have *static storage duration*. The storage for these entities lasts for
the duration of the program [basic.start.static], [basic.start.term].

If a variable with static storage duration has initialization or a
destructor with side effects, it shall not be eliminated even if it
appears to be unused, except that a class object or its copy/move may be
eliminated as specified in  [class.copy.elision].

\[*Note 17*:  The keyword `static` can be used to declare a block
variable [basic.scope.block] with static storage duration; [stmt.dcl]
and [basic.start.term] describe the initialization and destruction of
such variables. The keyword `static` applied to a class data member in a
class definition gives the data member static storage duration
[class.static.data]. — *end note*\]

#### Thread storage duration <a id="basic.stc.thread">[basic.stc.thread]</a>

All variables declared with the `thread_local` keyword have
*thread storage duration*. The storage for these entities lasts for the
duration of the thread in which they are created. There is a distinct
object or reference per thread, and use of the declared name refers to
the entity associated with the current thread.

\[*Note 18*: A variable with thread storage duration is initialized as
specified in  [basic.start.static], [basic.start.dynamic], and
[stmt.dcl] and, if constructed, is destroyed on thread exit
[basic.start.term]. — *end note*\]

#### Automatic storage duration <a id="basic.stc.auto">[basic.stc.auto]</a>

Variables that belong to a block or parameter scope and are not
explicitly declared `static`, `thread_local`, or `extern` have
*automatic storage duration*. The storage for these entities lasts until
the block in which they are created exits.

\[*Note 19*: These variables are initialized and destroyed as described
in  [stmt.dcl]. — *end note*\]

If a variable with automatic storage duration has initialization or a
destructor with side effects, an implementation shall not destroy it
before the end of its block nor eliminate it as an optimization, even if
it appears to be unused, except that a class object or its copy/move may
be eliminated as specified in  [class.copy.elision].

#### Dynamic storage duration <a id="basic.stc.dynamic">[basic.stc.dynamic]</a>

##### General <a id="basic.stc.dynamic.general">[basic.stc.dynamic.general]</a>

Objects can be created dynamically during program execution
[intro.execution], using *new-expression* [expr.new], and destroyed
using *delete-expression* [expr.delete]. A C++ implementation provides
access to, and management of, dynamic storage via the global
*allocation functions* `operator new` and `operator new[]` and the
global *deallocation functions* `operator delete` and
`operator delete[]`.

\[*Note 20*: The non-allocating forms described in
[new.delete.placement] do not perform allocation or
deallocation. — *end note*\]

The library provides default definitions for the global allocation and
deallocation functions. Some global allocation and deallocation
functions are replaceable [new.delete]; these are attached to the global
module [module.unit]. A C++ program shall provide at most one definition
of a replaceable allocation or deallocation function. Any such function
definition replaces the default version provided in the library
[replacement.functions]. The following allocation and deallocation
functions [support.dynamic] are implicitly declared in global scope in
each translation unit of a program.

``` cpp
[[nodiscard]] void* operator new(std::size_t);
[[nodiscard]] void* operator new(std::size_t, std::align_val_t);

void operator delete(void*) noexcept;
void operator delete(void*, std::size_t) noexcept;
void operator delete(void*, std::align_val_t) noexcept;
void operator delete(void*, std::size_t, std::align_val_t) noexcept;

[[nodiscard]] void* operator new[](std::size_t);
[[nodiscard]] void* operator new[](std::size_t, std::align_val_t);

void operator delete[](void*) noexcept;
void operator delete[](void*, std::size_t) noexcept;
void operator delete[](void*, std::align_val_t) noexcept;
void operator delete[](void*, std::size_t, std::align_val_t) noexcept;
```

These implicit declarations introduce only the function names
`operator new`, `operator new[]`, `operator delete`, and
`operator delete[]`.

\[*Note 21*: The implicit declarations do not introduce the names `std`,
`std::size_t`, `std::align_val_t`, or any other names that the library
uses to declare these names. Thus, a *new-expression*,
*delete-expression*, or function call that refers to one of these
functions without importing or including the header or importing a C++
library module [std.modules] is well-formed. However, referring to `std`
or `std::size_t` or `std::align_val_t` is ill-formed unless a standard
library declaration [cstddef.syn], [new.syn], [std.modules] of that name
precedes [basic.lookup.general] the use of that name. — *end note*\]

Allocation and/or deallocation functions may also be declared and
defined for any class [class.free].

If the behavior of an allocation or deallocation function does not
satisfy the semantic constraints specified in 
[basic.stc.dynamic.allocation] and  [basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation],
the behavior is undefined.

##### Allocation functions <a id="basic.stc.dynamic.allocation">[basic.stc.dynamic.allocation]</a>

An allocation function that is not a class member function shall belong
to the global scope and not have a name with internal linkage. The
return type shall be `void*`. The first parameter shall have type
`std::size_t` [support.types]. The first parameter shall not have an
associated default argument [dcl.fct.default]. The value of the first
parameter is interpreted as the requested size of the allocation. An
allocation function can be a function template. Such a template shall
declare its return type and first parameter as specified above (that is,
template parameter types shall not be used in the return type and first
parameter type). Allocation function templates shall have two or more
parameters.

An allocation function attempts to allocate the requested amount of
storage. If it is successful, it returns the address of the start of a
block of storage whose length in bytes is at least as large as the
requested size. The order, contiguity, and initial value of storage
allocated by successive calls to an allocation function are unspecified.
Even if the size of the space requested is zero, the request can fail.
If the request succeeds, the value returned by a replaceable allocation
function is a non-null pointer value [basic.compound] `p0` different
from any previously returned value `p1`, unless that value `p1` was
subsequently passed to a replaceable deallocation function. Furthermore,
for the library allocation functions in  [new.delete.single] and 
[new.delete.array], `p0` represents the address of a block of storage
disjoint from the storage for any other object accessible to the caller.
The effect of indirecting through a pointer returned from a request for
zero size is undefined.

For an allocation function other than a reserved placement allocation
function [new.delete.placement], the pointer returned on a successful
call shall represent the address of storage that is aligned as follows:

- If the allocation function takes an argument of type
  `std::align_val_t`, the storage will have the alignment specified by
  the value of this argument.

- Otherwise, if the allocation function is named `operator new[]`, the
  storage is aligned for any object that does not have new-extended
  alignment [basic.align] and is no larger than the requested size.

- Otherwise, the storage is aligned for any object that does not have
  new-extended alignment and is of the requested size.

An allocation function that fails to allocate storage can invoke the
currently installed new-handler function [new.handler], if any.

\[*Note 22*:  A program-supplied allocation function can obtain the
address of the currently installed `new_handler` using the
`std::get_new_handler` function [get.new.handler]. — *end note*\]

An allocation function that has a non-throwing exception specification
[except.spec] indicates failure by returning a null pointer value. Any
other allocation function never returns a null pointer value and
indicates failure only by throwing an exception [except.throw] of a type
that would match a handler [except.handle] of type `std::bad_alloc`
[bad.alloc].

A global allocation function is only called as the result of a new
expression [expr.new], or called directly using the function call syntax
[expr.call], or called indirectly to allocate storage for a coroutine
state [dcl.fct.def.coroutine], or called indirectly through calls to the
functions in the C++ standard library.

\[*Note 23*: In particular, a global allocation function is not called
to allocate storage for objects with static storage duration
[basic.stc.static], for objects or references with thread storage
duration [basic.stc.thread], for objects of type `std::type_info`
[expr.typeid], or for an exception object [except.throw]. — *end note*\]

##### Deallocation functions <a id="basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation">[basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation]</a>

A deallocation function that is not a class member function shall belong
to the global scope and not have a name with internal linkage.

A deallocation function is a *destroying operator delete* if it has at
least two parameters and its second parameter is of type
`std::destroying_delete_t`. A destroying operator delete shall be a
class member function named `operator delete`.

\[*Note 24*: Array deletion cannot use a destroying operator
delete. — *end note*\]

Each deallocation function shall return `void`. If the function is a
destroying operator delete declared in class type `C`, the type of its
first parameter shall be `C*`; otherwise, the type of its first
parameter shall be `void*`. A deallocation function may have more than
one parameter. A *usual deallocation function* is a deallocation
function whose parameters after the first are

- optionally, a parameter of type `std::destroying_delete_t`, then

- optionally, a parameter of type `std::size_t`,

  then

- optionally, a parameter of type `std::align_val_t`.

A destroying operator delete shall be a usual deallocation function. A
deallocation function may be an instance of a function template. Neither
the first parameter nor the return type shall depend on a template
parameter. A deallocation function template shall have two or more
function parameters. A template instance is never a usual deallocation
function, regardless of its signature.

If a deallocation function terminates by throwing an exception, the
behavior is undefined. The value of the first argument supplied to a
deallocation function may be a null pointer value; if so, and if the
deallocation function is one supplied in the standard library, the call
has no effect.

If the argument given to a deallocation function in the standard library
is a pointer that is not the null pointer value [basic.compound], the
deallocation function shall deallocate the storage referenced by the
pointer, ending the duration of the region of storage.

#### Duration of subobjects <a id="basic.stc.inherit">[basic.stc.inherit]</a>

The storage duration of subobjects and reference members is that of
their complete object [intro.object].

### Alignment <a id="basic.align">[basic.align]</a>

Object types have *alignment requirements*
[basic.fundamental], [basic.compound] which place restrictions on the
addresses at which an object of that type may be allocated. An
*alignment* is an *implementation-defined* integer value representing
the number of bytes between successive addresses at which a given object
can be allocated. An object type imposes an alignment requirement on
every object of that type; stricter alignment can be requested using the
alignment specifier [dcl.align].

A *fundamental alignment* is represented by an alignment less than or
equal to the greatest alignment supported by the implementation in all
contexts, which is equal to `alignof(std::max_align_t)` [support.types].
The alignment required for a type may be different when it is used as
the type of a complete object and when it is used as the type of a
subobject.

\[*Example 10*:

``` cpp
struct B { long double d; };
struct D : virtual B { char c; };
```

When `D` is the type of a complete object, it will have a subobject of
type `B`, so it must be aligned appropriately for a `long double`. If
`D` appears as a subobject of another object that also has `B` as a
virtual base class, the `B` subobject might be part of a different
subobject, reducing the alignment requirements on the `D` subobject.

— *end example*\]

The result of the `alignof` operator reflects the alignment requirement
of the type in the complete-object case.

An *extended alignment* is represented by an alignment greater than
`alignof(std::max_align_t)`. It is *implementation-defined* whether any
extended alignments are supported and the contexts in which they are
supported [dcl.align]. A type having an extended alignment requirement
is an *over-aligned type*.

\[*Note 25*: Every over-aligned type is or contains a class type to
which extended alignment applies (possibly through a non-static data
member). — *end note*\]

A *new-extended alignment* is represented by an alignment greater than
\_\_STDCPP_DEFAULT_NEW_ALIGNMENT\_\_ [cpp.predefined].

Alignments are represented as values of the type `std::size_t`. Valid
alignments include only those values returned by an `alignof` expression
for the fundamental types plus an additional *implementation-defined*
set of values, which may be empty. Every alignment value shall be a
non-negative integral power of two.

Alignments have an order from *weaker* to *stronger* or *stricter*
alignments. Stricter alignments have larger alignment values. An address
that satisfies an alignment requirement also satisfies any weaker valid
alignment requirement.

The alignment requirement of a complete type can be queried using an
`alignof` expression [expr.alignof]. Furthermore, the narrow character
types [basic.fundamental] shall have the weakest alignment requirement.

\[*Note 26*: This enables the ordinary character types to be used as the
underlying type for an aligned memory area [dcl.align]. — *end note*\]

Comparing alignments is meaningful and provides the obvious results:

- Two alignments are equal when their numeric values are equal.

- Two alignments are different when their numeric values are not equal.

- When an alignment is larger than another it represents a stricter
  alignment.

\[*Note 27*: The runtime pointer alignment function [ptr.align] can be
used to obtain an aligned pointer within a buffer; an
*alignment-specifier* [dcl.align] can be used to align storage
explicitly. — *end note*\]

If a request for a specific extended alignment in a specific context is
not supported by an implementation, the program is ill-formed.

### Temporary objects <a id="class.temporary">[class.temporary]</a>

Temporary objects are created

- when a prvalue is converted to an xvalue [conv.rval],

- when needed by the implementation to pass or return an object of
  trivially copyable type (see below), and

- when throwing an exception [except.throw].

  \[*Note 8*: The lifetime of exception objects is described in 
  [except.throw]. — *end note*\]

Even when the creation of the temporary object is unevaluated
[expr.context], all the semantic restrictions shall be respected as if
the temporary object had been created and later destroyed.

\[*Note 28*: This includes accessibility [class.access] and whether it
is deleted, for the constructor selected and for the destructor.
However, in the special case of the operand of a *decltype-specifier*
[dcl.type.decltype], no temporary is introduced, so the foregoing does
not apply to such a prvalue. — *end note*\]

The materialization of a temporary object is generally delayed as long
as possible in order to avoid creating unnecessary temporary objects.

\[*Note 29*:

Temporary objects are materialized:

- when binding a reference to a prvalue
  [dcl.init.ref], [expr.type.conv], [expr.dynamic.cast], [expr.static.cast], [expr.const.cast], [expr.cast],

- when performing member access on a class prvalue
  [expr.ref], [expr.mptr.oper],

- when performing an array-to-pointer conversion or subscripting on an
  array prvalue [conv.array], [expr.sub],

- when initializing an object of type `std::initializer_list<T>` from a
  *braced-init-list* [dcl.init.list],

- for certain unevaluated operands [expr.typeid], [expr.sizeof], and

- when a prvalue that has type other than cv `void` appears as a
  discarded-value expression [expr.context].

— *end note*\]

\[*Example 11*:

Consider the following code:

``` cpp
class X {
public:
  X(int);
  X(const X&);
  X& operator=(const X&);
  ~X();
};

class Y {
public:
  Y(int);
  Y(Y&&);
  ~Y();
};

X f(X);
Y g(Y);

void h() {
  X a(1);
  X b = f(X(2));
  Y c = g(Y(3));
  a = f(a);
}
```

`X(2)` is constructed in the space used to hold `f()`’s argument and
`Y(3)` is constructed in the space used to hold `g()`’s argument.
Likewise, `f()`’s result is constructed directly in `b` and `g()`’s
result is constructed directly in `c`. On the other hand, the expression
`a = f(a)` requires a temporary for the result of `f(a)`, which is
materialized so that the reference parameter of `X::operator=(const X&)`
can bind to it.

— *end example*\]

When an object of class type `X` is passed to or returned from a
function, if `X` has at least one eligible copy or move constructor
[special], each such constructor is trivial, and the destructor of `X`
is either trivial or deleted, implementations are permitted to create a
temporary object to hold the function parameter or result object. The
temporary object is constructed from the function argument or return
value, respectively, and the function’s parameter or return object is
initialized as if by using the eligible trivial constructor to copy the
temporary (even if that constructor is inaccessible or would not be
selected by overload resolution to perform a copy or move of the
object).

\[*Note 30*: This latitude is granted to allow objects of class type to
be passed to or returned from functions in registers. — *end note*\]

When an implementation introduces a temporary object of a class that has
a non-trivial constructor [class.default.ctor], [class.copy.ctor], it
shall ensure that a constructor is called for the temporary object.
Similarly, the destructor shall be called for a temporary with a
non-trivial destructor [class.dtor]. Temporary objects are destroyed as
the last step in evaluating the full-expression [intro.execution] that
(lexically) contains the point where they were created. This is true
even if that evaluation ends in throwing an exception. The value
computations and side effects of destroying a temporary object are
associated only with the full-expression, not with any specific
subexpression.

There are four contexts in which temporaries are destroyed at a
different point than the end of the full-expression. The first context
is when a default constructor is called to initialize an element of an
array with no corresponding initializer [dcl.init]. The second context
is when a copy constructor is called to copy an element of an array
while the entire array is copied
[expr.prim.lambda.capture], [class.copy.ctor]. In either case, if the
constructor has one or more default arguments, the destruction of every
temporary created in a default argument is sequenced before the
construction of the next array element, if any.

The third context is when a reference binds to a temporary object.

The temporary object to which the reference is bound or the temporary
object that is the complete object of a subobject to which the reference
is bound persists for the lifetime of the reference if the glvalue to
which the reference is bound was obtained through one of the following:

- a temporary materialization conversion [conv.rval],

- `(` *expression* `)`, where *expression* is one of these expressions,

- subscripting [expr.sub] of an array operand, where that operand is one
  of these expressions,

- a class member access [expr.ref] using the `.` operator where the left
  operand is one of these expressions and the right operand designates a
  non-static data member of non-reference type,

- a pointer-to-member operation [expr.mptr.oper] using the `.*` operator
  where the left operand is one of these expressions and the right
  operand is a pointer to data member of non-reference type,

- a

  - `const_cast` [expr.const.cast],

  - `static_cast` [expr.static.cast],

  - `dynamic_cast` [expr.dynamic.cast], or

  - 

  converting, without a user-defined conversion, a glvalue operand that
  is one of these expressions to a glvalue that refers to the object
  designated by the operand, or to its complete object or a subobject
  thereof,

- a conditional expression [expr.cond] that is a glvalue where the
  second or third operand is one of these expressions, or

- a comma expression [expr.comma] that is a glvalue where the right
  operand is one of these expressions.

\[*Example 12*:

``` cpp
template<typename T> using id = T;

int i = 1;
int&& a = id<int[3]>{1, 2, 3}[i];           // temporary array has same lifetime as a
const int& b = static_cast<const int&>(0);  // temporary int has same lifetime as b
int&& c = cond ? id<int[3]>{1, 2, 3}[i] : static_cast<int&&>(0);
                                            // exactly one of the two temporaries is lifetime-extended
```

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 31*:

An explicit type conversion [expr.type.conv], [expr.cast] is interpreted
as a sequence of elementary casts, covered above.

— *end note*\]

\[*Note 32*:

If a temporary object has a reference member initialized by another
temporary object, lifetime extension applies recursively to such a
member’s initializer.

— *end note*\]

The exceptions to this lifetime rule are:

- A temporary object bound to a reference parameter in a function call
  [expr.call] persists until the completion of the full-expression
  containing the call.

- A temporary object bound to a reference element of an aggregate of
  class type initialized from a parenthesized *expression-list*
  [dcl.init] persists until the completion of the full-expression
  containing the *expression-list*.

- The lifetime of a temporary bound to the returned value in a function
  `return` statement [stmt.return] is not extended; the temporary is
  destroyed at the end of the full-expression in the `return` statement.

- A temporary bound to a reference in a *new-initializer* [expr.new]
  persists until the completion of the full-expression containing the
  *new-initializer*.

  \[*Note 9*: This might introduce a dangling reference. — *end note*\]

  \[*Example 2*:

  ``` cpp
  struct S { int mi; const std::pair<int,int>& mp; };
  S a { 1, {2,3} };
  S* p = new S{ 1, {2,3} };       // creates dangling reference
  ```

  — *end example*\]

The fourth context is when a temporary object other than a function
parameter object is created in the *for-range-initializer* of a
range-based `for` statement. If such a temporary object would otherwise
be destroyed at the end of the *for-range-initializer* full-expression,
the object persists for the lifetime of the reference initialized by the
*for-range-initializer*.

The destruction of a temporary whose lifetime is not extended beyond the
full-expression in which it was created is sequenced before the
destruction of every temporary which is constructed earlier in the same
full-expression. If the lifetime of two or more temporaries with
lifetimes extending beyond the full-expressions in which they were
created ends at the same point, these temporaries are destroyed at that
point in the reverse order of the completion of their construction. In
addition, the destruction of such temporaries shall take into account
the ordering of destruction of objects with static, thread, or automatic
storage duration
[basic.stc.static], [basic.stc.thread], [basic.stc.auto]; that is, if
`obj1` is an object with the same storage duration as the temporary and
created before the temporary is created the temporary shall be destroyed
before `obj1` is destroyed; if `obj2` is an object with the same storage
duration as the temporary and created after the temporary is created the
temporary shall be destroyed after `obj2` is destroyed.

\[*Example 13*:

``` cpp
struct S {
  S();
  S(int);
  friend S operator+(const S&, const S&);
  ~S();
};
S obj1;
const S& cr = S(16)+S(23);
S obj2;
```

The expression `S(16) + S(23)` creates three temporaries: a first
temporary `T1` to hold the result of the expression `S(16)`, a second
temporary `T2` to hold the result of the expression `S(23)`, and a third
temporary `T3` to hold the result of the addition of these two
expressions. The temporary `T3` is then bound to the reference `cr`. It
is unspecified whether `T1` or `T2` is created first. On an
implementation where `T1` is created before `T2`, `T2` shall be
destroyed before `T1`. The temporaries `T1` and `T2` are bound to the
reference parameters of `operator+`; these temporaries are destroyed at
the end of the full-expression containing the call to `operator+`. The
temporary `T3` bound to the reference `cr` is destroyed at the end of
`cr`’s lifetime, that is, at the end of the program. In addition, the
order in which `T3` is destroyed takes into account the destruction
order of other objects with static storage duration. That is, because
`obj1` is constructed before `T3`, and `T3` is constructed before
`obj2`, `obj2` shall be destroyed before `T3`, and `T3` shall be
destroyed before `obj1`.

— *end example*\]

## Types <a id="basic.types">[basic.types]</a>

### General <a id="basic.types.general">[basic.types.general]</a>

\[*Note 1*:  [basic.types] and the subclauses thereof impose
requirements on implementations regarding the representation of types.
There are two kinds of types: fundamental types and compound types.
Types describe objects [intro.object], references [dcl.ref], or
functions [dcl.fct]. — *end note*\]

For any object (other than a potentially-overlapping subobject) of
trivially copyable type `T`, whether or not the object holds a valid
value of type `T`, the underlying bytes [intro.memory] making up the
object can be copied into an array of `char`, `unsigned char`, or
`std::byte` [cstddef.syn].

If the content of that array is copied back into the object, the object
shall subsequently hold its original value.

\[*Example 1*:

``` cpp
constexpr std::size_t N = sizeof(T);
char buf[N];
T obj;                          // obj initialized to its original value
std::memcpy(buf, &obj, N);      // between these two calls to std::memcpy, obj might be modified
std::memcpy(&obj, buf, N);      // at this point, each subobject of obj of scalar type holds its original value
```

— *end example*\]

For two distinct objects `obj1` and `obj2` of trivially copyable type
`T`, where neither `obj1` nor `obj2` is a potentially-overlapping
subobject, if the underlying bytes [intro.memory] making up `obj1` are
copied into `obj2`,

`obj2` shall subsequently hold the same value as `obj1`.

\[*Example 2*:

``` cpp
T* t1p;
T* t2p;
    // provided that t2p points to an initialized object ...
std::memcpy(t1p, t2p, sizeof(T));
    // at this point, every subobject of trivially copyable type in *t1p contains
    // the same value as the corresponding subobject in *t2p
```

— *end example*\]

The *object representation* of an object of type `T` is the sequence of
*N* `unsigned char` objects taken up by the object of type `T`, where
*N* equals `sizeof(T)`. The *value representation* of an object of type
`T` is the set of bits that participate in representing a value of type
`T`. Bits in the object representation that are not part of the value
representation are *padding bits*. For trivially copyable types, the
value representation is a set of bits in the object representation that
determines a *value*, which is one discrete element of an
*implementation-defined* set of values.

A class that has been declared but not defined, an enumeration type in
certain contexts [dcl.enum], or an array of unknown bound or of
incomplete element type, is an *incompletely-defined object type*.

Incompletely-defined object types and cv `void` are [basic.fundamental].

\[*Note 2*: Objects cannot be defined to have an incomplete type
[basic.def]. — *end note*\]

A class type (such as “`class X`”) can be incomplete at one point in a
translation unit and complete later on; the type “`class X`” is the same
type at both points. The declared type of an array object can be an
array of incomplete class type and therefore incomplete; if the class
type is completed later on in the translation unit, the array type
becomes complete; the array type at those two points is the same type.
The declared type of an array object can be an array of unknown bound
and therefore be incomplete at one point in a translation unit and
complete later on; the array types at those two points (“array of
unknown bound of `T`” and “array of `N` `T`”) are different types.

\[*Note 3*: The type of a pointer or reference to array of unknown bound
permanently points to or refers to an incomplete type. An array of
unknown bound named by a `typedef` declaration permanently refers to an
incomplete type. In either case, the array type cannot be
completed. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 3*:

``` cpp
class X;                        // X is an incomplete type
extern X* xp;                   // xp is a pointer to an incomplete type
extern int arr[];               // the type of arr is incomplete
typedef int UNKA[];             // UNKA is an incomplete type
UNKA* arrp;                     // arrp is a pointer to an incomplete type
UNKA** arrpp;

void foo() {
  xp++;                         // error: X is incomplete
  arrp++;                       // error: incomplete type
  arrpp++;                      // OK, sizeof UNKA* is known
}

struct X { int i; };            // now X is a complete type
int  arr[10];                   // now the type of arr is complete

X x;
void bar() {
  xp = &x;                      // OK; type is ``pointer to X''
  arrp = &arr;                  // OK; qualification conversion[conv.qual]
  xp++;                         // OK, X is complete
  arrp++;                       // error: UNKA can't be completed
}
```

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 4*: The rules for declarations and expressions describe in which
contexts incomplete types are prohibited. — *end note*\]

An *object type* is a (possibly cv-qualified) type that is not a
function type, not a reference type, and not cv `void`.

Arithmetic types [basic.fundamental], enumeration types, pointer types,
pointer-to-member types [basic.compound], `std::nullptr_t`, and
cv-qualified [basic.type.qualifier] versions of these types are
collectively called . Scalar types, trivially copyable class types
[class.prop], arrays of such types, and cv-qualified versions of these
types are collectively called . Scalar types, trivial class types
[class.prop], arrays of such types and cv-qualified versions of these
types are collectively called . Scalar types, standard-layout class
types [class.prop], arrays of such types and cv-qualified versions of
these types are collectively called . Scalar types, implicit-lifetime
class types [class.prop], array types, and cv-qualified versions of
these types are collectively called .

A type is a *literal type* if it is:

- cv `void`; or

- a scalar type; or

- a reference type; or

- an array of literal type; or

- a possibly cv-qualified class type [class] that has all of the
  following properties:

  - it has a constexpr destructor [dcl.constexpr],

  - all of its non-static non-variant data members and base classes are
    of non-volatile literal types, and

  - it

    - is a closure type [expr.prim.lambda.closure],

    - is an aggregate union type that has either no variant members or
      at least one variant member of non-volatile literal type,

    - is a non-union aggregate type for which each of its anonymous
      union members satisfies the above requirements for an aggregate
      union type, or

    - has at least one constexpr constructor or constructor template
      (possibly inherited [namespace.udecl] from a base class) that is
      not a copy or move constructor.

\[*Note 5*: A literal type is one for which it might be possible to
create an object within a constant expression. It is not a guarantee
that it is possible to create such an object, nor is it a guarantee that
any object of that type will be usable in a constant
expression. — *end note*\]

Two types `T1` and `T2` are if `T1` and `T2` are the same type,
layout-compatible enumerations [dcl.enum], or layout-compatible
standard-layout class types [class.mem].

### Fundamental types <a id="basic.fundamental">[basic.fundamental]</a>

There are five : “`signed char`”, “`short int`”, “`int`”, “`long int`”,
and “`long long int`”. In this list, each type provides at least as much
storage as those preceding it in the list. There may also be
*implementation-defined* . The standard and extended signed integer
types are collectively called . The range of representable values for a
signed integer type is $-2^{N-1}$ to $2^{N-1}-1$ (inclusive), where *N*
is called the *width* of the type.

\[*Note 6*: Plain `int`s are intended to have the natural width
suggested by the architecture of the execution environment; the other
signed integer types are provided to meet special needs. — *end note*\]

For each of the standard signed integer types, there exists a
corresponding (but different) *standard unsigned integer type*:
“`unsigned char`”, “`unsigned short int`”, “`unsigned int`”,
“`unsigned long int`”, and “`unsigned long long int`”. Likewise, for
each of the extended signed integer types, there exists a corresponding
*extended unsigned integer type*. The standard and extended unsigned
integer types are collectively called . An unsigned integer type has the
same width *N* as the corresponding signed integer type. The range of
representable values for the unsigned type is 0 to $2^N-1$ (inclusive);
arithmetic for the unsigned type is performed modulo $2^N$.

\[*Note 7*: Unsigned arithmetic does not overflow. Overflow for signed
arithmetic yields undefined behavior [expr.pre]. — *end note*\]

An unsigned integer type has the same object representation, value
representation, and alignment requirements [basic.align] as the
corresponding signed integer type. For each value x of a signed integer
type, the value of the corresponding unsigned integer type congruent to
x modulo $2^N$ has the same value of corresponding bits in its value
representation.

\[*Example 4*: The value -1 of a signed integer type has the same
representation as the largest value of the corresponding unsigned
type. — *end example*\]

**Table: Minimum width**

| Type | Minimum width $N$ |
| --- | --- |
| `\texttt{signed` `char`} | 8 |
| `\texttt{short` `int`} | 16 |
| `int` | 16 |
| `\texttt{long` `int`} | 32 |
| `\texttt{long` `long` `int`} | 64 |
The width of each signed integer type shall not be less than the values
specified in [basic.fundamental.width]. The value representation of a
signed or unsigned integer type comprises N bits, where N is the
respective width. Each set of values for any padding bits
[basic.types.general] in the object representation are alternative
representations of the value specified by the value representation.

\[*Note 8*: Padding bits have unspecified value, but cannot cause traps.
In contrast, see ISO C 6.2.6.2. — *end note*\]

\[*Note 9*: The signed and unsigned integer types satisfy the
constraints given in ISO C 5.2.4.2.1. — *end note*\]

Except as specified above, the width of a signed or unsigned integer
type is *implementation-defined*.

Each value x of an unsigned integer type with width N has a unique
representation $x = x_0 2^0 + x_1 2^1 + \ldots + x_{N-1} 2^{N-1}$, where
each coefficient xᵢ is either 0 or 1; this is called the
*base-2 representation* of x. The base-2 representation of a value of
signed integer type is the base-2 representation of the congruent value
of the corresponding unsigned integer type. The standard signed integer
types and standard unsigned integer types are collectively called the ,
and the extended signed integer types and extended unsigned integer
types are collectively called the .

A fundamental type specified to have a signed or unsigned integer type
as its *underlying type* has the same object representation, value
representation, alignment requirements [basic.align], and range of
representable values as the underlying type. Further, each value has the
same representation in both types.

Type `char` is a distinct type that has an *implementation-defined*
choice of “`signed char`” or “`unsigned char`” as its underlying type.
The three types `char`, `signed char`, and `unsigned char` are
collectively called . The ordinary character types and `char8_t` are
collectively called . For narrow character types, each possible bit
pattern of the object representation represents a distinct value.

\[*Note 10*: This requirement does not hold for other
types. — *end note*\]

\[*Note 11*: A bit-field of narrow character type whose width is larger
than the width of that type has padding bits; see
[basic.types.general]. — *end note*\]

Type `wchar_t` is a distinct type that has an *implementation-defined*
signed or unsigned integer type as its underlying type.

Type `char8_t` denotes a distinct type whose underlying type is
`unsigned char`. Types `char16_t` and `char32_t` denote distinct types
whose underlying types are `uint_least16_t` and `uint_least32_t`,
respectively, in .

Type `bool` is a distinct type that has the same object representation,
value representation, and alignment requirements as an
*implementation-defined* unsigned integer type. The values of type
`bool` are `true` and `false`.

\[*Note 12*: There are no `signed`, `unsigned`, `short`, or `long bool`
types or values. — *end note*\]

The types `char`, `wchar_t`, `char8_t`, `char16_t`, and `char32_t` are
collectively called . The character types, `bool`, the signed and
unsigned integer types, and cv-qualified versions [basic.type.qualifier]
thereof, are collectively termed *integral types*. A synonym for
integral type is *integer type*.

\[*Note 13*: Enumerations [dcl.enum] are not integral; however, unscoped
enumerations can be promoted to integral types as specified in
[conv.prom]. — *end note*\]

The three distinct types `float`, `double`, and `long double` can
represent floating-point numbers. The type `double` provides at least as
much precision as `float`, and the type `long double` provides at least
as much precision as `double`. The set of values of the type `float` is
a subset of the set of values of the type `double`; the set of values of
the type `double` is a subset of the set of values of the type
`long double`. The types `float`, `double`, and `long double`, and
cv-qualified versions [basic.type.qualifier] thereof, are collectively
termed *standard floating-point types*. An implementation may also
provide additional types that represent floating-point values and define
them (and cv-qualified versions thereof) to be
*extended floating-point types*. The standard and extended
floating-point types are collectively termed *floating-point types*.

\[*Note 14*: Any additional implementation-specific types representing
floating-point values that are not defined by the implementation to be
extended floating-point types are not considered to be floating-point
types, and this document imposes no requirements on them or their
interactions with floating-point types. — *end note*\]

Except as specified in [basic.extended.fp], the object and value
representations and accuracy of operations of floating-point types are
*implementation-defined*.

Integral and floating-point types are collectively termed
*arithmetic types*.

\[*Note 15*: Properties of the arithmetic types, such as their minimum
and maximum representable value, can be queried using the facilities in
the standard library headers , , and . — *end note*\]

A type cv `void` is an incomplete type that cannot be completed; such a
type has an empty set of values. It is used as the return type for
functions that do not return a value. Any expression can be explicitly
converted to type cv `void`
[expr.type.conv], [expr.static.cast], [expr.cast]. An expression of type
cv `void` shall be used only as an expression statement [stmt.expr], as
an operand of a comma expression [expr.comma], as a second or third
operand of `?:` [expr.cond], as the operand of `typeid`, `noexcept`, or
`decltype`, as the expression in a `return` statement [stmt.return] for
a function with the return type cv `void`, or as the operand of an
explicit conversion to type cv `void`.

A value of type `std::nullptr_t` is a null pointer constant [conv.ptr].
Such values participate in the pointer and the pointer-to-member
conversions [conv.ptr], [conv.mem]. `sizeof(std::nullptr_t)` shall be
equal to `sizeof(void*)`.

The types described in this subclause are called *fundamental types*.

\[*Note 16*: Even if the implementation defines two or more fundamental
types to have the same value representation, they are nevertheless
different types. — *end note*\]

### Optional extended floating-point types <a id="basic.extended.fp">[basic.extended.fp]</a>

If the implementation supports an extended floating-point type
[basic.fundamental] whose properties are specified by the ISO/IEC/IEEE
60559 floating-point interchange format binary16, then the
*typedef-name* `std::float16_t` is defined in the header and names such
a type, the macro \_\_STDCPP_FLOAT16_T\_\_ is defined [cpp.predefined],
and the floating-point literal suffixes `f16` and `F16` are supported
[lex.fcon].

If the implementation supports an extended floating-point type whose
properties are specified by the ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 floating-point
interchange format binary32, then the *typedef-name* `std::float32_t` is
defined in the header `<stdfloat>` and names such a type, the macro
\_\_STDCPP_FLOAT32_T\_\_ is defined, and the floating-point literal
suffixes `f32` and `F32` are supported.

If the implementation supports an extended floating-point type whose
properties are specified by the ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 floating-point
interchange format binary64, then the *typedef-name* `std::float64_t` is
defined in the header `<stdfloat>` and names such a type, the macro
\_\_STDCPP_FLOAT64_T\_\_ is defined, and the floating-point literal
suffixes `f64` and `F64` are supported.

If the implementation supports an extended floating-point type whose
properties are specified by the ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 floating-point
interchange format binary128, then the *typedef-name* `std::float128_t`
is defined in the header `<stdfloat>` and names such a type, the macro
\_\_STDCPP_FLOAT128_T\_\_ is defined, and the floating-point literal
suffixes `f128` and `F128` are supported.

If the implementation supports an extended floating-point type with the
properties, as specified by ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559, of radix (b) of 2,
storage width in bits (k) of 16, precision in bits (p) of 8, maximum
exponent (emax) of 127, and exponent field width in bits (w) of 8, then
the *typedef-name* `std::bfloat16_t` is defined in the header
`<stdfloat>` and names such a type, the macro \_\_STDCPP_BFLOAT16_T\_\_
is defined, and the floating-point literal suffixes `bf16` and `BF16`
are supported.

\[*Note 17*: A summary of the parameters for each type is given in
[basic.extended.fp]. The precision p includes the implicit 1 bit at the
beginning of the mantissa, so the storage used for the mantissa is p-1
bits. ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559 does not assign a name for a type having the
parameters specified for `std::bfloat16_t`. — *end note*\]

Any names that the implementation provides for the extended
floating-point types described in this subsection that are in addition
to the names defined in the `<stdfloat>` header should be chosen to
increase compatibility and interoperability with the interchange types
`_Float16`, `_Float32`, `_Float64`, and `_Float128` defined in ISO/IEC
TS 18661-3 and with future versions of the C standard.

### Compound types <a id="basic.compound">[basic.compound]</a>

Compound types can be constructed in the following ways:

- *arrays* of objects of a given type, [dcl.array];

- *functions*, which have parameters of given types and return `void` or
  references or objects of a given type, [dcl.fct];

- *pointers* to cv `void` or objects or functions (including static
  members of classes) of a given type, [dcl.ptr];

-  *references* to objects or functions of a given type, [dcl.ref].
  There are two types of references:

  - lvalue reference

  - rvalue reference

- *classes* containing a sequence of objects of various types [class], a
  set of types, enumerations and functions for manipulating these
  objects [class.mfct], and a set of restrictions on the access to these
  entities [class.access];

- *unions*, which are classes capable of containing objects of different
  types at different times, [class.union];

- *enumerations*, which comprise a set of named constant values,
  [dcl.enum];

-  *pointers to non-static class members*,

  which identify members of a given type within objects of a given
  class, [dcl.mptr]. Pointers to data members and pointers to member
  functions are collectively called *pointer-to-member* types.

These methods of constructing types can be applied recursively;
restrictions are mentioned in  [dcl.meaning]. Constructing a type such
that the number of bytes in its object representation exceeds the
maximum value representable in the type `std::size_t` [support.types] is
ill-formed.

The type of a pointer to cv `void` or a pointer to an object type is
called an *object pointer type*.

\[*Note 18*: A pointer to `void` does not have a pointer-to-object type,
however, because `void` is not an object type. — *end note*\]

The type of a pointer that can designate a function is called a
*function pointer type*. A pointer to an object of type `T` is referred
to as a “pointer to `T`”.

\[*Example 5*: A pointer to an object of type `int` is referred to as
“pointer to `int`” and a pointer to an object of class `X` is called a
“pointer to `X`”. — *end example*\]

Except for pointers to static members, text referring to “pointers” does
not apply to pointers to members. Pointers to incomplete types are
allowed although there are restrictions on what can be done with them
[basic.align]. Every value of pointer type is one of the following:

- a *pointer to* an object or function (the pointer is said to *point*
  to the object or function), or

- a *pointer past the end of* an object [expr.add], or

- the *null pointer value* for that type, or

- an *invalid pointer value*.

A value of a pointer type that is a pointer to or past the end of an
object *represents the address* of the first byte in memory
[intro.memory] occupied by the object

or the first byte in memory after the end of the storage occupied by the
object, respectively.

\[*Note 19*: A pointer past the end of an object [expr.add] is not
considered to point to an unrelated object of the object’s type, even if
the unrelated object is located at that address. A pointer value becomes
invalid when the storage it denotes reaches the end of its storage
duration; see [basic.stc]. — *end note*\]

For purposes of pointer arithmetic [expr.add] and comparison
[expr.rel], [expr.eq], a pointer past the end of the last element of an
array `x` of n elements is considered to be equivalent to a pointer to a
hypothetical array element n of `x` and an object of type `T` that is
not an array element is considered to belong to an array with one
element of type `T`. The value representation of pointer types is
*implementation-defined*. Pointers to layout-compatible types shall have
the same value representation and alignment requirements [basic.align].

\[*Note 20*: Pointers to over-aligned types [basic.align] have no
special representation, but their range of valid values is restricted by
the extended alignment requirement. — *end note*\]

Two objects *a* and *b* are *pointer-interconvertible* if:

- they are the same object, or

- one is a union object and the other is a non-static data member of
  that object [class.union], or

- one is a standard-layout class object and the other is the first
  non-static data member of that object or any base class subobject of
  that object [class.mem], or

- there exists an object *c* such that *a* and *c* are
  pointer-interconvertible, and *c* and *b* are
  pointer-interconvertible.

If two objects are pointer-interconvertible, then they have the same
address, and it is possible to obtain a pointer to one from a pointer to
the other via a `reinterpret_cast` [expr.reinterpret.cast].

\[*Note 21*: An array object and its first element are not
pointer-interconvertible, even though they have the same
address. — *end note*\]

A byte of storage *b* is *reachable through* a pointer value that points
to an object *x* if there is an object *y*, pointer-interconvertible
with *x*, such that *b* is within the storage occupied by *y*, or the
immediately-enclosing array object if *y* is an array element.

A pointer to cv `void` can be used to point to objects of unknown type.
Such a pointer shall be able to hold any object pointer. An object of
type “pointer to cv `void`” shall have the same representation and
alignment requirements as an object of type “pointer to cv `char`”.

### CV-qualifiers <a id="basic.type.qualifier">[basic.type.qualifier]</a>

Each type other than a function or reference type is part of a group of
four distinct, but related, types: a *cv-unqualified* version, a
*const-qualified* version, a *volatile-qualified* version, and a
*const-volatile-qualified* version. The types in each such group shall
have the same representation and alignment requirements [basic.align].

A function or reference type is always cv-unqualified.

- A *const object* is an object of type `const T` or a non-mutable
  subobject of a const object.

- A *volatile object* is an object of type `volatile T` or a subobject
  of a volatile object.

- A *const volatile object* is an object of type `const volatile T`, a
  non-mutable subobject of a const volatile object, a const subobject of
  a volatile object, or a non-mutable volatile subobject of a const
  object.

\[*Note 22*: The type of an object [intro.object] includes the
*cv-qualifier*s specified in the *decl-specifier-seq* [dcl.spec],
*declarator* [dcl.decl], *type-id* [dcl.name], or *new-type-id*
[expr.new] when the object is created. — *end note*\]

Except for array types, a compound type [basic.compound] is not
cv-qualified by the cv-qualifiers (if any) of the types from which it is
compounded.

An array type whose elements are cv-qualified is also considered to have
the same cv-qualifications as its elements.

\[*Note 23*: Cv-qualifiers applied to an array type attach to the
underlying element type, so the notation “cv `T`”, where `T` is an array
type, refers to an array whose elements are so-qualified
[dcl.array]. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 6*:

``` cpp
typedef char CA[5];
typedef const char CC;
CC arr1[5] = { 0 };
const CA arr2 = { 0 };
```

The type of both `arr1` and `arr2` is “array of 5 `const char`”, and the
array type is considered to be const-qualified.

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 24*: See  [dcl.fct] and  [over.match.funcs] regarding function
types that have *cv-qualifier*. — *end note*\]

There is a partial ordering on cv-qualifiers, so that a type can be said
to be *more cv-qualified* than another. [basic.type.qualifier.rel] shows
the relations that constitute this ordering.

**Table: Relations on `const` and `volatile`**

| \cvqual{no cv-qualifier} | < | `const` |
| \cvqual{no cv-qualifier} | < | `volatile` |
| \cvqual{no cv-qualifier} | < | `\texttt{const` `volatile`} |
| `const` | < | `\texttt{const` `volatile`} |
| `volatile` | < | `\texttt{const` `volatile`} |
In this document, the notation cv (or , , etc.), used in the description
of types, represents an arbitrary set of cv-qualifiers, i.e., one of
{`const`}, {`volatile`}, {`const`, `volatile`}, or the empty set. For a
type cv `T`, the *top-level cv-qualifiers* of that type are those
denoted by cv.

\[*Example 7*: The type corresponding to the *type-id* `const int&` has
no top-level cv-qualifiers. The type corresponding to the *type-id*
`volatile int * const` has the top-level cv-qualifier `const`. For a
class type `C`, the type corresponding to the *type-id*
`void (C::* volatile)(int) const` has the top-level cv-qualifier
`volatile`. — *end example*\]

### Conversion ranks <a id="conv.rank">[conv.rank]</a>

Every integer type has an *integer conversion rank* defined as follows:

- No two signed integer types other than `char` and `signed
  char` (if `char` is signed) have the same rank, even if they have the
  same representation.

- The rank of a signed integer type is greater than the rank of any
  signed integer type with a smaller width.

- The rank of `long long int` is greater than the rank of `long int`,
  which is greater than the rank of `int`, which is greater than the
  rank of `short int`, which is greater than the rank of `signed char`.

- The rank of any unsigned integer type equals the rank of the
  corresponding signed integer type.

- The rank of any standard integer type is greater than the rank of any
  extended integer type with the same width.

- The rank of `char` equals the rank of `signed char` and
  `unsigned char`.

- The rank of `bool` is less than the rank of all standard integer
  types.

-  The ranks of `char8_t`, `char16_t`, `char32_t`, and `wchar_t` equal
  the ranks of their underlying types [basic.fundamental].

- The rank of any extended signed integer type relative to another
  extended signed integer type with the same width is
  *implementation-defined*, but still subject to the other rules for
  determining the integer conversion rank.

- For all integer types `T1`, `T2`, and `T3`, if `T1` has greater rank
  than `T2` and `T2` has greater rank than `T3`, then `T1` has greater
  rank than `T3`.

\[*Note 25*: The integer conversion rank is used in the definition of
the integral promotions [conv.prom] and the usual arithmetic conversions
[expr.arith.conv]. — *end note*\]

Every floating-point type has a *floating-point conversion rank* defined
as follows:

- The rank of a floating point type `T` is greater than the rank of any
  floating-point type whose set of values is a proper subset of the set
  of values of `T`.

- The rank of `long double` is greater than the rank of `double`, which
  is greater than the rank of `float`.

- Two extended floating-point types with the same set of values have
  equal ranks.

- An extended floating-point type with the same set of values as exactly
  one cv-unqualified standard floating-point type has a rank equal to
  the rank of that standard floating-point type.

- An extended floating-point type with the same set of values as more
  than one cv-unqualified standard floating-point type has a rank equal
  to the rank of `double`.

\[*Note 26*: The conversion ranks of floating-point types `T1` and `T2`
are unordered if the set of values of `T1` is neither a subset nor a
superset of the set of values of `T2`. This can happen when one type has
both a larger range and a lower precision than the other. — *end note*\]

Floating-point types that have equal floating-point conversion ranks are
ordered by floating-point conversion subrank. The subrank forms a total
order among types with equal ranks. The types `std::float16_t`,
`std::float32_t`, `std::float64_t`, and `std::float128_t` [stdfloat.syn]
have a greater conversion subrank than any standard floating-point type
with equal conversion rank. Otherwise, the conversion subrank order is
*implementation-defined*.

\[*Note 27*: The floating-point conversion rank and subrank are used in
the definition of the usual arithmetic conversions
[expr.arith.conv]. — *end note*\]

## Program execution <a id="basic.exec">[basic.exec]</a>

### Sequential execution <a id="intro.execution">[intro.execution]</a>

An instance of each object with automatic storage duration
[basic.stc.auto] is associated with each entry into its block. Such an
object exists and retains its last-stored value during the execution of
the block and while the block is suspended (by a call of a function,
suspension of a coroutine [expr.await], or receipt of a signal).

A *constituent expression* is defined as follows:

- The constituent expression of an expression is that expression.

- The constituent expression of a conversion is the corresponding
  implicit function call, if any, or the converted expression otherwise.

- The constituent expressions of a *braced-init-list* or of a (possibly
  parenthesized) *expression-list* are the constituent expressions of
  the elements of the respective list.

- The constituent expressions of a *brace-or-equal-initializer* of the
  form `=` *initializer-clause* are the constituent expressions of the
  *initializer-clause*.

\[*Example 1*:

``` cpp
struct A { int x; };
struct B { int y; struct A a; };
B b = { 5, { 1+1 } };
```

The constituent expressions of the *initializer* used for the
initialization of `b` are `5` and `1+1`.

— *end example*\]

The *immediate subexpressions* of an expression E are

- the constituent expressions of E’s operands [expr.prop],

- any function call that E implicitly invokes,

- if E is a *lambda-expression* [expr.prim.lambda], the initialization
  of the entities captured by copy and the constituent expressions of
  the *initializer* of the *init-capture*,

- if E is a function call [expr.call] or implicitly invokes a function,
  the constituent expressions of each default argument [dcl.fct.default]
  used in the call, or

- if E creates an aggregate object [dcl.init.aggr], the constituent
  expressions of each default member initializer [class.mem] used in the
  initialization.

A *subexpression* of an expression E is an immediate subexpression of E
or a subexpression of an immediate subexpression of E.

\[*Note 1*: Expressions appearing in the *compound-statement* of a
*lambda-expression* are not subexpressions of the
*lambda-expression*. — *end note*\]

The of an expression, conversion, or *initializer* E are

- the constituent expressions of E and

- the subexpressions thereof that are not subexpressions of a nested
  unevaluated operand [term.unevaluated.operand].

A *full-expression* is

- an unevaluated operand [expr.context],

- a *constant-expression* [expr.const],

- an immediate invocation [expr.const],

- an *init-declarator* [dcl.decl] or a *mem-initializer*
  [class.base.init], including the constituent expressions of the
  initializer,

- an invocation of a destructor generated at the end of the lifetime of
  an object other than a temporary object [class.temporary] whose
  lifetime has not been extended, or

- an expression that is not a subexpression of another expression and
  that is not otherwise part of a full-expression.

If a language construct is defined to produce an implicit call of a
function, a use of the language construct is considered to be an
expression for the purposes of this definition. Conversions applied to
the result of an expression in order to satisfy the requirements of the
language construct in which the expression appears are also considered
to be part of the full-expression. For an initializer, performing the
initialization of the entity (including evaluating default member
initializers of an aggregate) is also considered part of the
full-expression.

\[*Example 2*:

``` cpp
struct S {
  S(int i): I(i) { }            // full-expression is initialization of I
  int& v() { return I; }
  ~S() noexcept(false) { }
private:
  int I;
};

S s1(1);                        // full-expression comprises call of S::S(int)
void f() {
  S s2 = 2;                     // full-expression comprises call of S::S(int)
  if (S(3).v())                 // full-expression includes lvalue-to-rvalue and int to bool conversions,
                                // performed before temporary is deleted at end of full-expression
  { }
  bool b = noexcept(S());       // exception specification of destructor of S considered for noexcept

  // full-expression is destruction of s2 at end of block
}
struct B {
  B(S = S(0));
};
B b[2] = { B(), B() };          // full-expression is the entire initialization
                                // including the destruction of temporaries
```

— *end example*\]

\[*Note 2*: The evaluation of a full-expression can include the
evaluation of subexpressions that are not lexically part of the
full-expression. For example, subexpressions involved in evaluating
default arguments [dcl.fct.default] are considered to be created in the
expression that calls the function, not the expression that defines the
default argument. — *end note*\]

Reading an object designated by a `volatile` glvalue [basic.lval],
modifying an object, calling a library I/O function, or calling a
function that does any of those operations are all *side effects*, which
are changes in the state of the execution environment. *Evaluation* of
an expression (or a subexpression) in general includes both value
computations (including determining the identity of an object for
glvalue evaluation and fetching a value previously assigned to an object
for prvalue evaluation) and initiation of side effects. When a call to a
library I/O function returns or an access through a volatile glvalue is
evaluated the side effect is considered complete, even though some
external actions implied by the call (such as the I/O itself) or by the
`volatile` access may not have completed yet.

*Sequenced before* is an asymmetric, transitive, pair-wise relation
between evaluations executed by a single thread [intro.multithread],
which induces a partial order among those evaluations. Given any two
evaluations *A* and *B*, if *A* is sequenced before *B* (or,
equivalently, *B* is *sequenced after* *A*), then the execution of *A*
shall precede the execution of *B*. If *A* is not sequenced before *B*
and *B* is not sequenced before *A*, then *A* and *B* are *unsequenced*.

\[*Note 3*: The execution of unsequenced evaluations can
overlap. — *end note*\]

Evaluations *A* and *B* are *indeterminately sequenced* when either *A*
is sequenced before *B* or *B* is sequenced before *A*, but it is
unspecified which.

\[*Note 4*: Indeterminately sequenced evaluations cannot overlap, but
either can be executed first. — *end note*\]

An expression *X* is said to be sequenced before an expression *Y* if
every value computation and every side effect associated with the
expression *X* is sequenced before every value computation and every
side effect associated with the expression *Y*.

Every value computation and side effect associated with a
full-expression is sequenced before every value computation and side
effect associated with the next full-expression to be evaluated.

Except where noted, evaluations of operands of individual operators and
of subexpressions of individual expressions are unsequenced.

\[*Note 5*: In an expression that is evaluated more than once during the
execution of a program, unsequenced and indeterminately sequenced
evaluations of its subexpressions need not be performed consistently in
different evaluations. — *end note*\]

The value computations of the operands of an operator are sequenced
before the value computation of the result of the operator. If a side
effect on a memory location [intro.memory] is unsequenced relative to
either another side effect on the same memory location or a value
computation using the value of any object in the same memory location,
and they are not potentially concurrent [intro.multithread], the
behavior is undefined.

\[*Note 6*: The next subclause imposes similar, but more complex
restrictions on potentially concurrent computations. — *end note*\]

\[*Example 3*:

``` cpp
void g(int i) {
  i = 7, i++, i++;              // i becomes 9

  i = i++ + 1;                  // the value of i is incremented
  i = i++ + i;                  // undefined behavior
  i = i + 1;                    // the value of i is incremented
}
```

— *end example*\]

When invoking a function (whether or not the function is inline), every
argument expression and the postfix expression designating the called
function are sequenced before every expression or statement in the body
of the called function. For each function invocation or evaluation of an
*await-expression* *F*, each evaluation that does not occur within *F*
but is evaluated on the same thread and as part of the same signal
handler (if any) is either sequenced before all evaluations that occur
within *F* or sequenced after all evaluations that occur within *F*;

if *F* invokes or resumes a coroutine [expr.await], only evaluations
subsequent to the previous suspension (if any) and prior to the next
suspension (if any) are considered to occur within *F*.

Several contexts in C++ cause evaluation of a function call, even though
no corresponding function call syntax appears in the translation unit.

\[*Example 4*: Evaluation of a *new-expression* invokes one or more
allocation and constructor functions; see  [expr.new]. For another
example, invocation of a conversion function [class.conv.fct] can arise
in contexts in which no function call syntax appears. — *end example*\]

The sequencing constraints on the execution of the called function (as
described above) are features of the function calls as evaluated,
regardless of the syntax of the expression that calls the function.

If a signal handler is executed as a result of a call to the
`std::raise` function, then the execution of the handler is sequenced
after the invocation of the `std::raise` function and before its return.

\[*Note 7*: When a signal is received for another reason, the execution
of the signal handler is usually unsequenced with respect to the rest of
the program. — *end note*\]

### Multi-threaded executions and data races <a id="intro.multithread">[intro.multithread]</a>

#### General <a id="intro.multithread.general">[intro.multithread.general]</a>

A *thread of execution* (also known as a *thread*) is a single flow of
control within a program, including the initial invocation of a specific
top-level function, and recursively including every function invocation
subsequently executed by the thread.

\[*Note 8*: When one thread creates another, the initial call to the
top-level function of the new thread is executed by the new thread, not
by the creating thread. — *end note*\]

Every thread in a program can potentially access every object and
function in a program.

Under a hosted implementation, a C++ program can have more than one
thread running concurrently. The execution of each thread proceeds as
defined by the remainder of this document. The execution of the entire
program consists of an execution of all of its threads.

\[*Note 9*: Usually the execution can be viewed as an interleaving of
all its threads. However, some kinds of atomic operations, for example,
allow executions inconsistent with a simple interleaving, as described
below. — *end note*\]

Under a freestanding implementation, it is *implementation-defined*
whether a program can have more than one thread of execution.

For a signal handler that is not executed as a result of a call to the
`std::raise` function, it is unspecified which thread of execution
contains the signal handler invocation.

#### Data races <a id="intro.races">[intro.races]</a>

The value of an object visible to a thread T at a particular point is
the initial value of the object, a value assigned to the object by T, or
a value assigned to the object by another thread, according to the rules
below.

\[*Note 10*: In some cases, there might instead be undefined behavior.
Much of this subclause is motivated by the desire to support atomic
operations with explicit and detailed visibility constraints. However,
it also implicitly supports a simpler view for more restricted
programs. — *end note*\]

Two expression evaluations *conflict* if one of them modifies a memory
location [intro.memory] and the other one reads or modifies the same
memory location.

The library defines a number of atomic operations [atomics] and
operations on mutexes [thread] that are specially identified as
synchronization operations. These operations play a special role in
making assignments in one thread visible to another. A synchronization
operation on one or more memory locations is either a consume operation,
an acquire operation, a release operation, or both an acquire and
release operation. A synchronization operation without an associated
memory location is a fence and can be either an acquire fence, a release
fence, or both an acquire and release fence. In addition, there are
relaxed atomic operations, which are not synchronization operations, and
atomic read-modify-write operations, which have special characteristics.

\[*Note 11*: For example, a call that acquires a mutex will perform an
acquire operation on the locations comprising the mutex.
Correspondingly, a call that releases the same mutex will perform a
release operation on those same locations. Informally, performing a
release operation on A forces prior side effects on other memory
locations to become visible to other threads that later perform a
consume or an acquire operation on A. “Relaxed” atomic operations are
not synchronization operations even though, like synchronization
operations, they cannot contribute to data races. — *end note*\]

All modifications to a particular atomic object M occur in some
particular total order, called the *modification order* of M.

\[*Note 12*: There is a separate order for each atomic object. There is
no requirement that these can be combined into a single total order for
all objects. In general this will be impossible since different threads
can observe modifications to different objects in inconsistent
orders. — *end note*\]

A *release sequence* headed by a release operation A on an atomic object
M is a maximal contiguous sub-sequence of side effects in the
modification order of M, where the first operation is A, and every
subsequent operation is an atomic read-modify-write operation.

Certain library calls *synchronize with* other library calls performed
by another thread. For example, an atomic store-release synchronizes
with a load-acquire that takes its value from the store [atomics.order].

\[*Note 13*: Except in the specified cases, reading a later value does
not necessarily ensure visibility as described below. Such a requirement
would sometimes interfere with efficient implementation. — *end note*\]

\[*Note 14*: The specifications of the synchronization operations define
when one reads the value written by another. For atomic objects, the
definition is clear. All operations on a given mutex occur in a single
total order. Each mutex acquisition “reads the value written” by the
last mutex release. — *end note*\]

An evaluation A *carries a dependency* to an evaluation B if

- the value of A is used as an operand of B, unless:

  - B is an invocation of any specialization of `std::kill_dependency`
    [atomics.order], or

  - A is the left operand of a built-in logical (`&&`, see 
    [expr.log.and]) or logical (`||`, see  [expr.log.or]) operator, or

  - A is the left operand of a conditional (`?:`, see  [expr.cond])
    operator, or

  - A is the left operand of the built-in comma (`,`) operator
    [expr.comma];

  or

- A writes a scalar object or bit-field M, B reads the value written by
  A from M, and A is sequenced before B, or

- for some evaluation X, A carries a dependency to X, and X carries a
  dependency to B.

\[*Note 15*: “Carries a dependency to” is a subset of “is sequenced
before”, and is similarly strictly intra-thread. — *end note*\]

An evaluation A is *dependency-ordered before* an evaluation B if

- A performs a release operation on an atomic object M, and, in another
  thread, B performs a consume operation on M and reads the value
  written by A, or

- for some evaluation X, A is dependency-ordered before X and X carries
  a dependency to B.

\[*Note 16*: The relation “is dependency-ordered before” is analogous to
“synchronizes with”, but uses release/consume in place of
release/acquire. — *end note*\]

An evaluation A *inter-thread happens before* an evaluation B if

- A synchronizes with B, or

- A is dependency-ordered before B, or

- for some evaluation X

  - A synchronizes with X and X is sequenced before B, or

  - A is sequenced before X and X inter-thread happens before B, or

  - A inter-thread happens before X and X inter-thread happens before B.

\[*Note 17*: The “inter-thread happens before” relation describes
arbitrary concatenations of “sequenced before”, “synchronizes with” and
“dependency-ordered before” relationships, with two exceptions. The
first exception is that a concatenation is not permitted to end with
“dependency-ordered before” followed by “sequenced before”. The reason
for this limitation is that a consume operation participating in a
“dependency-ordered before” relationship provides ordering only with
respect to operations to which this consume operation actually carries a
dependency. The reason that this limitation applies only to the end of
such a concatenation is that any subsequent release operation will
provide the required ordering for a prior consume operation. The second
exception is that a concatenation is not permitted to consist entirely
of “sequenced before”. The reasons for this limitation are (1) to permit
“inter-thread happens before” to be transitively closed and (2) the
“happens before” relation, defined below, provides for relationships
consisting entirely of “sequenced before”. — *end note*\]

An evaluation A *happens before* an evaluation B (or, equivalently, B
*happens after* A) if:

- A is sequenced before B, or

- A inter-thread happens before B.

The implementation shall ensure that no program execution demonstrates a
cycle in the “happens before” relation.

\[*Note 18*: This cycle would otherwise be possible only through the use
of consume operations. — *end note*\]

An evaluation A *simply happens before* an evaluation B if either

- A is sequenced before B, or

- A synchronizes with B, or

- A simply happens before X and X simply happens before B.

\[*Note 19*: In the absence of consume operations, the happens before
and simply happens before relations are identical. — *end note*\]

An evaluation A *strongly happens before* an evaluation D if, either

- A is sequenced before D, or

- A synchronizes with D, and both A and D are sequentially consistent
  atomic operations [atomics.order], or

- there are evaluations B and C such that A is sequenced before B, B
  simply happens before C, and C is sequenced before D, or

- there is an evaluation B such that A strongly happens before B, and B
  strongly happens before D.

\[*Note 20*: Informally, if A strongly happens before B, then A appears
to be evaluated before B in all contexts. Strongly happens before
excludes consume operations. — *end note*\]

A A on a scalar object or bit-field M with respect to a value
computation B of M satisfies the conditions:

- A happens before B and

- there is no other side effect X to M such that A happens before X and
  X happens before B.

The value of a non-atomic scalar object or bit-field M, as determined by
evaluation B, shall be the value stored by the visible side effect A.

\[*Note 21*: If there is ambiguity about which side effect to a
non-atomic object or bit-field is visible, then the behavior is either
unspecified or undefined. — *end note*\]

\[*Note 22*: This states that operations on ordinary objects are not
visibly reordered. This is not actually detectable without data races,
but it is necessary to ensure that data races, as defined below, and
with suitable restrictions on the use of atomics, correspond to data
races in a simple interleaved (sequentially consistent)
execution. — *end note*\]

The value of an atomic object M, as determined by evaluation B, shall be
the value stored by some side effect A that modifies M, where B does not
happen before A.

\[*Note 23*: The set of such side effects is also restricted by the rest
of the rules described here, and in particular, by the coherence
requirements below. — *end note*\]

If an operation A that modifies an atomic object M happens before an
operation B that modifies M, then A shall be earlier than B in the
modification order of M.

\[*Note 24*: This requirement is known as write-write
coherence. — *end note*\]

If a value computation A of an atomic object M happens before a value
computation B of M, and A takes its value from a side effect X on M,
then the value computed by B shall either be the value stored by X or
the value stored by a side effect Y on M, where Y follows X in the
modification order of M.

\[*Note 25*: This requirement is known as read-read
coherence. — *end note*\]

If a value computation A of an atomic object M happens before an
operation B that modifies M, then A shall take its value from a side
effect X on M, where X precedes B in the modification order of M.

\[*Note 26*: This requirement is known as read-write
coherence. — *end note*\]

If a side effect X on an atomic object M happens before a value
computation B of M, then the evaluation B shall take its value from X or
from a side effect Y that follows X in the modification order of M.

\[*Note 27*: This requirement is known as write-read
coherence. — *end note*\]

\[*Note 28*: The four preceding coherence requirements effectively
disallow compiler reordering of atomic operations to a single object,
even if both operations are relaxed loads. This effectively makes the
cache coherence guarantee provided by most hardware available to C++
atomic operations. — *end note*\]

\[*Note 29*: The value observed by a load of an atomic depends on the
“happens before” relation, which depends on the values observed by loads
of atomics. The intended reading is that there must exist an association
of atomic loads with modifications they observe that, together with
suitably chosen modification orders and the “happens before” relation
derived as described above, satisfy the resulting constraints as imposed
here. — *end note*\]

Two actions are *potentially concurrent* if

- they are performed by different threads, or

- they are unsequenced, at least one is performed by a signal handler,
  and they are not both performed by the same signal handler invocation.

The execution of a program contains a *data race* if it contains two
potentially concurrent conflicting actions, at least one of which is not
atomic, and neither happens before the other, except for the special
case for signal handlers described below. Any such data race results in
undefined behavior.

\[*Note 30*: It can be shown that programs that correctly use mutexes
and `memory_order::seq_cst` operations to prevent all data races and use
no other synchronization operations behave as if the operations executed
by their constituent threads were simply interleaved, with each value
computation of an object being taken from the last side effect on that
object in that interleaving. This is normally referred to as “sequential
consistency”. However, this applies only to data-race-free programs, and
data-race-free programs cannot observe most program transformations that
do not change single-threaded program semantics. In fact, most
single-threaded program transformations continue to be allowed, since
any program that behaves differently as a result has undefined
behavior. — *end note*\]

Two accesses to the same object of type `volatile std::sig_atomic_t` do
not result in a data race if both occur in the same thread, even if one
or more occurs in a signal handler. For each signal handler invocation,
evaluations performed by the thread invoking a signal handler can be
divided into two groups A and B, such that no evaluations in B happen
before evaluations in A, and the evaluations of such
`volatile std::sig_atomic_t` objects take values as though all
evaluations in A happened before the execution of the signal handler and
the execution of the signal handler happened before all evaluations in
B.

\[*Note 31*: Compiler transformations that introduce assignments to a
potentially shared memory location that would not be modified by the
abstract machine are generally precluded by this document, since such an
assignment might overwrite another assignment by a different thread in
cases in which an abstract machine execution would not have encountered
a data race. This includes implementations of data member assignment
that overwrite adjacent members in separate memory locations. Reordering
of atomic loads in cases in which the atomics in question might alias is
also generally precluded, since this could violate the coherence
rules. — *end note*\]

\[*Note 32*: Transformations that introduce a speculative read of a
potentially shared memory location might not preserve the semantics of
the C++ program as defined in this document, since they potentially
introduce a data race. However, they are typically valid in the context
of an optimizing compiler that targets a specific machine with
well-defined semantics for data races. They would be invalid for a
hypothetical machine that is not tolerant of races or provides hardware
race detection. — *end note*\]

#### Forward progress <a id="intro.progress">[intro.progress]</a>

The implementation may assume that any thread will eventually do one of
the following:

- terminate,

- make a call to a library I/O function,

- perform an access through a volatile glvalue, or

- perform a synchronization operation or an atomic operation.

\[*Note 33*: This is intended to allow compiler transformations such as
removal of empty loops, even when termination cannot be
proven. — *end note*\]

Executions of atomic functions that are either defined to be lock-free
[atomics.flag] or indicated as lock-free [atomics.lockfree] are
*lock-free executions*.

- If there is only one thread that is not blocked [defns.block] in a
  standard library function, a lock-free execution in that thread shall
  complete.

  \[*Note 10*: Concurrently executing threads might prevent progress of
  a lock-free execution. For example, this situation can occur with
  load-locked store-conditional implementations. This property is
  sometimes termed obstruction-free. — *end note*\]

- When one or more lock-free executions run concurrently, at least one
  should complete.

  \[*Note 11*: It is difficult for some implementations to provide
  absolute guarantees to this effect, since repeated and particularly
  inopportune interference from other threads could prevent forward
  progress, e.g., by repeatedly stealing a cache line for unrelated
  purposes between load-locked and store-conditional instructions. For
  implementations that follow this recommendation and ensure that such
  effects cannot indefinitely delay progress under expected operating
  conditions, such anomalies can therefore safely be ignored by
  programmers. Outside this document, this property is sometimes termed
  lock-free. — *end note*\]

During the execution of a thread of execution, each of the following is
termed an *execution step*:

- termination of the thread of execution,

- performing an access through a volatile glvalue, or

- completion of a call to a library I/O function, a synchronization
  operation, or an atomic operation.

An invocation of a standard library function that blocks [defns.block]
is considered to continuously execute execution steps while waiting for
the condition that it blocks on to be satisfied.

\[*Example 5*: A library I/O function that blocks until the I/O
operation is complete can be considered to continuously check whether
the operation is complete. Each such check consists of one or more
execution steps, for example using observable behavior of the abstract
machine. — *end example*\]

\[*Note 34*: Because of this and the preceding requirement regarding
what threads of execution have to perform eventually, it follows that no
thread of execution can execute forever without an execution step
occurring. — *end note*\]

A thread of execution *makes progress* when an execution step occurs or
a lock-free execution does not complete because there are other
concurrent threads that are not blocked in a standard library function
(see above).

For a thread of execution providing
*concurrent forward progress guarantees*, the implementation ensures
that the thread will eventually make progress for as long as it has not
terminated.

\[*Note 35*: This is required regardless of whether or not other threads
of execution (if any) have been or are making progress. To eventually
fulfill this requirement means that this will happen in an unspecified
but finite amount of time. — *end note*\]

It is *implementation-defined* whether the implementation-created thread
of execution that executes `main` [basic.start.main] and the threads of
execution created by `std::thread` [thread.thread.class] or
`std::jthread` [thread.jthread.class] provide concurrent forward
progress guarantees. General-purpose implementations should provide
these guarantees.

For a thread of execution providing
*parallel forward progress guarantees*, the implementation is not
required to ensure that the thread will eventually make progress if it
has not yet executed any execution step; once this thread has executed a
step, it provides concurrent forward progress guarantees.

\[*Note 36*: This does not specify a requirement for when to start this
thread of execution, which will typically be specified by the entity
that creates this thread of execution. For example, a thread of
execution that provides concurrent forward progress guarantees and
executes tasks from a set of tasks in an arbitrary order, one after the
other, satisfies the requirements of parallel forward progress for these
tasks. — *end note*\]

For a thread of execution providing *weakly parallel forward progress
guarantees*, the implementation does not ensure that the thread will
eventually make progress.

\[*Note 37*: Threads of execution providing weakly parallel forward
progress guarantees cannot be expected to make progress regardless of
whether other threads make progress or not; however, blocking with
forward progress guarantee delegation, as defined below, can be used to
ensure that such threads of execution make progress
eventually. — *end note*\]

Concurrent forward progress guarantees are stronger than parallel
forward progress guarantees, which in turn are stronger than weakly
parallel forward progress guarantees.

\[*Note 38*: For example, some kinds of synchronization between threads
of execution might only make progress if the respective threads of
execution provide parallel forward progress guarantees, but will fail to
make progress under weakly parallel guarantees. — *end note*\]

When a thread of execution P is specified to block (execution)!with
forward progress guarantee delegation on the completion of a set S of
threads of execution, then throughout the whole time of P being blocked
on S, the implementation shall ensure that the forward progress
guarantees provided by at least one thread of execution in S is at least
as strong as P’s forward progress guarantees.

\[*Note 39*: It is unspecified which thread or threads of execution in S
are chosen and for which number of execution steps. The strengthening is
not permanent and not necessarily in place for the rest of the lifetime
of the affected thread of execution. As long as P is blocked, the
implementation has to eventually select and potentially strengthen a
thread of execution in S. — *end note*\]

Once a thread of execution in S terminates, it is removed from S. Once S
is empty, P is unblocked.

\[*Note 40*: A thread of execution B thus can temporarily provide an
effectively stronger forward progress guarantee for a certain amount of
time, due to a second thread of execution A being blocked on it with
forward progress guarantee delegation. In turn, if B then blocks with
forward progress guarantee delegation on C, this can also temporarily
provide a stronger forward progress guarantee to C. — *end note*\]

\[*Note 41*: If all threads of execution in S finish executing (e.g.,
they terminate and do not use blocking synchronization incorrectly),
then P’s execution of the operation that blocks with forward progress
guarantee delegation will not result in P’s progress guarantee being
effectively weakened. — *end note*\]

\[*Note 42*: This does not remove any constraints regarding blocking
synchronization for threads of execution providing parallel or weakly
parallel forward progress guarantees because the implementation is not
required to strengthen a particular thread of execution whose too-weak
progress guarantee is preventing overall progress. — *end note*\]

An implementation should ensure that the last value (in modification
order) assigned by an atomic or synchronization operation will become
visible to all other threads in a finite period of time.

### Start and termination <a id="basic.start">[basic.start]</a>

#### `main` function <a id="basic.start.main">[basic.start.main]</a>

A program shall contain exactly one function called `main` that belongs
to the global scope. Executing a program starts a main thread of
execution [intro.multithread], [thread.threads] in which the `main`
function is invoked. It is *implementation-defined* whether a program in
a freestanding environment is required to define a `main` function.

\[*Note 43*: In a freestanding environment, startup and termination is
*implementation-defined*; startup contains the execution of constructors
for non-local objects with static storage duration; termination contains
the execution of destructors for objects with static storage
duration. — *end note*\]

An implementation shall not predefine the `main` function. Its type
shall have C++ language linkage and it shall have a declared return type
of type `int`, but otherwise its type is *implementation-defined*. An
implementation shall allow both

- a function of `()` returning `int` and

- a function of `(int`, pointer to pointer to `char)` returning `int`

as the type of `main` [dcl.fct]. In the latter form, for purposes of
exposition, the first function parameter is called `argc` and the second
function parameter is called `argv`, where `argc` shall be the number of
arguments passed to the program from the environment in which the
program is run. If `argc` is nonzero these arguments shall be supplied
in `argv[0]` through `argv[argc-1]` as pointers to the initial
characters of null-terminated multibyte strings (NTMBSs)
[multibyte.strings] and `argv[0]` shall be the pointer to the initial
character of a NTMBS that represents the name used to invoke the program
or `""`. The value of `argc` shall be non-negative. The value of
`argv[argc]` shall be 0.

Any further (optional) parameters should be added after `argv`.

The function `main` shall not be used within a program. The linkage
[basic.link] of `main` is *implementation-defined*. A program that
defines `main` as deleted or that declares `main` to be `inline`,
`static`, `constexpr`, or `consteval` is ill-formed. The function `main`
shall not be a coroutine [dcl.fct.def.coroutine]. The `main` function
shall not be declared with a *linkage-specification* [dcl.link]. A
program that declares

- a variable `main` that belongs to the global scope, or

- a function `main` that belongs to the global scope and is attached to
  a named module, or

- a function template `main` that belongs to the global scope, or

- an entity named `main` with C language linkage (in any namespace)

is ill-formed. The name `main` is not otherwise reserved.

\[*Example 6*: Member functions, classes, and enumerations can be called
`main`, as can entities in other namespaces. — *end example*\]

Terminating the program without leaving the current block (e.g., by
calling the function `std::exit(int)` [support.start.term]) does not
destroy any objects with automatic storage duration [class.dtor]. If
`std::exit` is invoked during the destruction of an object with static
or thread storage duration, the program has undefined behavior.

A `return` statement [stmt.return] in `main` has the effect of leaving
the main function (destroying any objects with automatic storage
duration) and calling `std::exit` with the return value as the argument.
If control flows off the end of the *compound-statement* of `main`, the
effect is equivalent to a `return` with operand `0` (see also
[except.handle]).

#### Static initialization <a id="basic.start.static">[basic.start.static]</a>

Variables with static storage duration are initialized as a consequence
of program initiation. Variables with thread storage duration are
initialized as a consequence of thread execution. Within each of these
phases of initiation, initialization occurs as follows.

*Constant initialization* is performed if a variable or temporary object
with static or thread storage duration is constant-initialized
[expr.const]. If constant initialization is not performed, a variable
with static storage duration [basic.stc.static] or thread storage
duration [basic.stc.thread] is zero-initialized [dcl.init]. Together,
zero-initialization and constant initialization are called
*static initialization*; all other initialization is
*dynamic initialization*. All static initialization strongly happens
before [intro.races] any dynamic initialization.

\[*Note 44*: The dynamic initialization of non-block variables is
described in  [basic.start.dynamic]; that of static block variables is
described in  [stmt.dcl]. — *end note*\]

An implementation is permitted to perform the initialization of a
variable with static or thread storage duration as a static
initialization even if such initialization is not required to be done
statically, provided that

- the dynamic version of the initialization does not change the value of
  any other object of static or thread storage duration prior to its
  initialization, and

- the static version of the initialization produces the same value in
  the initialized variable as would be produced by the dynamic
  initialization if all variables not required to be initialized
  statically were initialized dynamically.

\[*Note 45*:

As a consequence, if the initialization of an object `obj1` refers to an
object `obj2` potentially requiring dynamic initialization and defined
later in the same translation unit, it is unspecified whether the value
of `obj2` used will be the value of the fully initialized `obj2`
(because `obj2` was statically initialized) or will be the value of
`obj2` merely zero-initialized. For example,

``` cpp
inline double fd() { return 1.0; }
extern double d1;
double d2 = d1;     // unspecified:
                    // either statically initialized to 0.0 or
                    // dynamically initialized to 0.0 if d1 is
                    // dynamically initialized, or 1.0 otherwise
double d1 = fd();   // either initialized statically or dynamically to 1.0
```

— *end note*\]

#### Dynamic initialization of non-block variables <a id="basic.start.dynamic">[basic.start.dynamic]</a>

Dynamic initialization of a non-block variable with static storage
duration is unordered if the variable is an implicitly or explicitly
instantiated specialization, is partially-ordered if the variable is an
inline variable that is not an implicitly or explicitly instantiated
specialization, and otherwise is ordered.

\[*Note 46*: A non-inline explicit specialization of a templated
variable has ordered initialization. — *end note*\]

A declaration `D` is *appearance-ordered* before a declaration `E` if

- `D` appears in the same translation unit as `E`, or

- the translation unit containing `E` has an interface dependency on the
  translation unit containing `D`,

in either case prior to `E`.

Dynamic initialization of non-block variables `V` and `W` with static
storage duration are ordered as follows:

- If `V` and `W` have ordered initialization and the definition of `V`
  is appearance-ordered before the definition of `W`, or if `V` has
  partially-ordered initialization, `W` does not have unordered
  initialization, and for every definition `E` of `W` there exists a
  definition `D` of `V` such that `D` is appearance-ordered before `E`,
  then

  - if the program does not start a thread [intro.multithread] other
    than the main thread [basic.start.main] or `V` and `W` have ordered
    initialization and they are defined in the same translation unit,
    the initialization of `V` is sequenced before the initialization of
    `W`;

  - otherwise, the initialization of `V` strongly happens before the
    initialization of `W`.

- Otherwise, if the program starts a thread other than the main thread
  before either `V` or `W` is initialized, it is unspecified in which
  threads the initializations of `V` and `W` occur; the initializations
  are unsequenced if they occur in the same thread.

- Otherwise, the initializations of `V` and `W` are indeterminately
  sequenced.

\[*Note 47*: This definition permits initialization of a sequence of
ordered variables concurrently with another sequence. — *end note*\]

A *non-initialization odr-use* is an odr-use [term.odr.use] not caused
directly or indirectly by the initialization of a non-block static or
thread storage duration variable.

It is *implementation-defined* whether the dynamic initialization of a
non-block non-inline variable with static storage duration is sequenced
before the first statement of `main` or is deferred. If it is deferred,
it strongly happens before any non-initialization odr-use of any
non-inline function or non-inline variable defined in the same
translation unit as the variable to be initialized.

It is *implementation-defined* in which threads and at which points in
the program such deferred dynamic initialization occurs.

An implementation should choose such points in a way that allows the
programmer to avoid deadlocks.

\[*Example 7*:

``` cpp
// - File 1 -
#include "a.h"
#include "b.h"
B b;
A::A() {
  b.Use();
}

// - File 2 -
#include "a.h"
A a;

// - File 3 -
#include "a.h"
#include "b.h"
extern A a;
extern B b;

int main() {
  a.Use();
  b.Use();
}
```

It is *implementation-defined* whether either `a` or `b` is initialized
before `main` is entered or whether the initializations are delayed
until `a` is first odr-used in `main`. In particular, if `a` is
initialized before `main` is entered, it is not guaranteed that `b` will
be initialized before it is odr-used by the initialization of `a`, that
is, before `A::A` is called. If, however, `a` is initialized at some
point after the first statement of `main`, `b` will be initialized prior
to its use in `A::A`.

— *end example*\]

It is *implementation-defined* whether the dynamic initialization of a
non-block inline variable with static storage duration is sequenced
before the first statement of `main` or is deferred. If it is deferred,
it strongly happens before any non-initialization odr-use of that
variable. It is *implementation-defined* in which threads and at which
points in the program such deferred dynamic initialization occurs.

It is *implementation-defined* whether the dynamic initialization of a
non-block non-inline variable with thread storage duration is sequenced
before the first statement of the initial function of a thread or is
deferred. If it is deferred, the initialization associated with the
entity for thread *t* is sequenced before the first non-initialization
odr-use by *t* of any non-inline variable with thread storage duration
defined in the same translation unit as the variable to be initialized.
It is *implementation-defined* in which threads and at which points in
the program such deferred dynamic initialization occurs.

If the initialization of a non-block variable with static or thread
storage duration exits via an exception, the function `std::terminate`
is called [except.terminate].

#### Termination <a id="basic.start.term">[basic.start.term]</a>

Constructed objects [dcl.init] with static storage duration are
destroyed and functions registered with `std::atexit` are called as part
of a call to `std::exit` [support.start.term]. The call to `std::exit`
is sequenced before the destructions and the registered functions.

\[*Note 48*: Returning from `main` invokes `std::exit`
[basic.start.main]. — *end note*\]

Constructed objects with thread storage duration within a given thread
are destroyed as a result of returning from the initial function of that
thread and as a result of that thread calling `std::exit`. The
destruction of all constructed objects with thread storage duration
within that thread strongly happens before destroying any object with
static storage duration.

If the completion of the constructor or dynamic initialization of an
object with static storage duration strongly happens before that of
another, the completion of the destructor of the second is sequenced
before the initiation of the destructor of the first. If the completion
of the constructor or dynamic initialization of an object with thread
storage duration is sequenced before that of another, the completion of
the destructor of the second is sequenced before the initiation of the
destructor of the first. If an object is initialized statically, the
object is destroyed in the same order as if the object was dynamically
initialized. For an object of array or class type, all subobjects of
that object are destroyed before any block variable with static storage
duration initialized during the construction of the subobjects is
destroyed. If the destruction of an object with static or thread storage
duration exits via an exception, the function `std::terminate` is called
[except.terminate].

If a function contains a block variable of static or thread storage
duration that has been destroyed and the function is called during the
destruction of an object with static or thread storage duration, the
program has undefined behavior if the flow of control passes through the
definition of the previously destroyed block variable.

\[*Note 49*: Likewise, the behavior is undefined if the block variable
is used indirectly (e.g., through a pointer) after its
destruction. — *end note*\]

If the completion of the initialization of an object with static storage
duration strongly happens before a call to `std::atexit` (see
`<cstdlib>`, [support.start.term]), the call to the function passed to
`std::atexit` is sequenced before the call to the destructor for the
object. If a call to `std::atexit` strongly happens before the
completion of the initialization of an object with static storage
duration, the call to the destructor for the object is sequenced before
the call to the function passed to `std::atexit`. If a call to
`std::atexit` strongly happens before another call to `std::atexit`, the
call to the function passed to the second `std::atexit` call is
sequenced before the call to the function passed to the first
`std::atexit` call.

If there is a use of a standard library object or function not permitted
within signal handlers [support.runtime] that does not happen before
[intro.multithread] completion of destruction of objects with static
storage duration and execution of `std::atexit` registered functions
[support.start.term], the program has undefined behavior.

\[*Note 50*: If there is a use of an object with static storage duration
that does not happen before the object’s destruction, the program has
undefined behavior. Terminating every thread before a call to
`std::exit` or the exit from `main` is sufficient, but not necessary, to
satisfy these requirements. These requirements permit thread managers as
static-storage-duration objects. — *end note*\]

Calling the function `std::abort()` declared in terminates the program
without executing any destructors and without calling the functions
passed to `std::atexit()` or `std::at_quick_exit()`.
