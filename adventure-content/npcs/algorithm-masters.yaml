          Ah, another programmer seeking algorithmic enlightenment!
          Have you heard about the power of `std::rotate`?

          It's the Swiss Army knife of the standard library.
          Most problems that seem to need raw loops can be solved
          elegantly with the right algorithm - often rotate!

            *Sean's eyes light up*

            `std::rotate` is perhaps the most underappreciated algorithm
            in the entire standard library!

            ```cpp
            // Rotate elements so middle becomes first
            std::rotate(first, middle, last);

            // Slide a range to a new position? rotate.
            // Insert at position? rotate.
            // Gather elements? rotate.
            ```

            Watch my talk to see rotate solve problem after problem:

            And when you're done, go talk to my friend Conor over there.
            He's built an entire series on algorithm intuition!

            Ah yes, "C++ Seasoning" - my talk on writing better code
            through proper use of algorithms.

            The key insights:
            1. **No raw loops** - there's almost always an algorithm
            2. **Rotate is magic** - it solves so many problems elegantly
            3. **Know your algorithms** - study them, internalize them

            After watching, talk to Conor about building algorithm intuition!

        algorithms:
          default: |
            The standard algorithms aren't just convenient - they're
            *correct by construction*. When you use `std::rotate` or
            `std::partition`, you're using code that's been reviewed
            by the best minds in C++ and optimized for decades.

            Raw loops hide intent. Algorithms reveal it.

          Welcome to Algorithm Academy! I'm Conor, and I'm on a mission
          to help everyone develop algorithm intuition!

          Have you watched Sean's C++ Seasoning talk yet?
          That's step one! Then come back and I'll teach you
          how to see the patterns that connect all the algorithms.

            Algorithm intuition isn't magic - it's a skill you can develop!
            But you need to learn it in the right order:

            **The Algorithm Intuition Learning Path:**

            1. 📺 First, watch Sean's talk to see WHY algorithms matter:
