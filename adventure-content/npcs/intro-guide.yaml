          Welcome, traveler, to the C++ Standard!

          I am the Standard Guardian, keeper of knowledge and guide to newcomers.
          This vast realm contains everything from basic fundamentals to the
          most advanced template metaprogramming.

          If you're just beginning, I have some tasks that will help you
          learn your way around. Type 'accept' to begin your journey!

          - **look** - See the current section's content
          - **map** - View your location in the realm

        navigation: |
          The Standard is organized into **realms**, each covering a major topic:

          - **The Grand Entrance** (intro) - Where you are now
          - **The Foundations** (basic) - Core language rules
          - **Lexicon Tower** (lex) - Tokens and lexical elements
          - **Expression Fields** (expr) - Operators and expressions
          - **Class Citadel** (class) - Classes and objects
          - **The Standard Library** (library) - Containers, algorithms, and more

          Use 'goto realm.section' to travel, or explore naturally with 'go'.
        realms: |
          Each realm has its own theme and guardians:

          - **intro** - The welcoming entrance hall
          - **basic** - Ancient ruins of fundamental rules
          - **lex** - A scholarly tower of tokens
          - **expr** - Testing grounds for expressions
          - **class** - A medieval citadel of OOP
          - **temp** - Frozen tundra of templates
          - **library** - The grand Standard Library halls

          Start with 'basic' to learn the fundamentals!
        timetravel: |
          The Standard evolves! You can visit different eras:

          - **n3337** - C++11 (where modern C++ began)
          - **n4140** - C++14 (refinements)
          - **n4659** - C++17 (major additions)
          - **n4861** - C++20 (concepts, ranges, coroutines)
          - **n4950** - C++23 (more refinements)
          - **trunk** - C++26 (the bleeding edge!)

          Use 'timeshift C++11' or 'timeshift n3337' to travel through time.
          Some content and NPCs change between eras!
    quests:
      - welcome_to_the_standard
      - explore_the_foundations
      - meet_the_guardians
      - chrono_compass_unlock
      - endl_truth
