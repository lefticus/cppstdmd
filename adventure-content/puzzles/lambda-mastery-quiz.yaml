    question: |
      Test your mastery of lambda evolution (True or False):

      1. Generic lambdas with `auto` parameters were introduced in C++11
      2. Init captures like `[x = std::move(ptr)]` became available in C++14
      3. C++17 allows capturing `*this` by value
      4. Template lambdas with explicit `<typename T>` syntax require C++20
      5. Deducing this (`this auto self`) enables recursive lambdas without std::function

    answers: [F, T, T, T, T]

    explanation: |
      1. FALSE - Generic lambdas with `auto` parameters were introduced in C++14,
         not C++11. C++11 lambdas required explicit parameter types.

      2. TRUE - Generalized capture expressions (init captures) came in C++14.
         This allows `[p = std::move(ptr)]` and `[y = x * 2]`.

      3. TRUE - C++17 added `[*this]` capture syntax, which captures a copy of
         the object. This is safer than `[this]` when the lambda outlives the object.

      4. TRUE - Template lambdas like `[]<typename T>(std::vector<T> const& v) {...}`
         were added in C++20, giving lambdas the full power of templates.

      5. TRUE - C++23's deducing this allows `[](this auto self, int n) {...}`,
         enabling recursive lambdas without the overhead of std::function.

    hints:
      - "Think about which version added 'auto' to lambda parameters..."
      - "C++14 was about making C++11 features more usable"
      - "Each standard added more template-like capabilities to lambdas"
