    description: Ancient wisdom about when NOT to define special members
    lore: |
      The Rule of Zero states: if you can avoid defining default operations, do.
      When a class needs no custom destructor, copy/move constructors, or
      copy/move assignment operators, it should define none of them.

      Classes that have custom destructors, copy/move constructors or
      copy/move assignment operators should deal exclusively with ownership.
      Other classes should not have custom destructors, copy/move constructors
      or copy/move assignment operators.

    name: Seal of Triviality
    category: pattern_crystal
    rarity: rare
    description: A seal that marks types optimized for memcpy
    lore: |
      A trivially copyable type can be safely copied byte-by-byte using memcpy.
      The compiler can generate no code for construction, destruction, or copying -
      the most efficient possible implementation.

      This seal glows brighter when near types that:
      - Have no user-provided special member functions
      - Have no virtual functions or virtual base classes
      - Have only trivially copyable non-static data members

      "Every cycle saved at compile-time is a cycle saved forever,
       and every operation the compiler can elide is code that never runs."
