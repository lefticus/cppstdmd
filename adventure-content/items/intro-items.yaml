  - id: chrono_compass
    name: Chrono Compass
    category: tool
    rarity: rare
    description: |
      An ancient compass that can navigate through the eras of C++.
      Its needle points not to north, but to moments in time.
    lore: |
      "Forged from fragments of every C++ standard,
      this compass remembers the path of the language.

      The earliest eras (C++98, C++03) are lost to the mists of time,
      but from C++11 onward, the compass can guide you:

      C++11 (n3337) - The rebirth. Move semantics, lambdas, auto.
      C++14 (n4140) - Refinement. Generic lambdas, relaxed constexpr.
      C++17 (n4659) - Expansion. if-init, structured bindings, fold.
      C++20 (n4861) - Revolution. Concepts, coroutines, ranges.
      C++23 (n4950) - Evolution. std::print, deducing this.
      C++26 (trunk) - The horizon. Reflection awaits.

      With this compass, you may walk the paths of history,
      witnessing how C++ evolved from strength to strength."
