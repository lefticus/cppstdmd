    rarity: uncommon
    description: A fragment of the C++14 constexpr revolution
    lore: |
      When the C++14 standard was ratified, constexpr functions
      were finally freed from their single-return prison.
      Loops, variables, if/else - all became legal at compile-time.
      This shard pulses with the energy of that liberation.

    name: Consteval Crystal
    category: pattern_crystal
    rarity: rare
    description: Crystallized essence of guaranteed compile-time evaluation
    lore: |
      Unlike its constexpr cousin, this crystal DEMANDS compile-time evaluation.
      There is no runtime fallback. The compiler must know the answer, or fail.
      It glows with an intensity that cannot be deferred to runtime.

  - id: constexpr_mastery_crystal
    name: Constexpr Mastery Crystal
    category: pattern_crystal
    rarity: rare
    description: Complete understanding of compile-time computation across all eras
    lore: |
      From the restrictive C++11 origins through the C++14 liberation,
      the C++17 conditional compilation, and C++20's dynamic allocation -
      this crystal embodies the full journey of constexpr. Those who
      possess it understand that every cycle saved at compile-time
      is a cycle saved forever.
